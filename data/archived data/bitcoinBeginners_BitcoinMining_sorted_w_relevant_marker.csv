Second question I have 2 s21 200t they are both hosted at the same facility on the same rack side by side and one puts out 210Th average and the other 198Th.  Not sure why this is or if it even matters really.

Urgent Inquiry: Cryptocurrency IOU Crisis at Poolin Requires Immediate Attention

Dear Cryptocurrency Journalists,

I am writing to bring to your attention a matter of significant concern within the cryptocurrency community that demands urgent investigation and public awareness. Over a year ago, Poolin, a prominent entity in the cryptocurrency mining space, faced liquidity issues leading to the issuance of a substantial volume of cryptocurrency IOUs, resulting in inadequate compensation for miners.

The repercussions of Poolin's actions have been devastating, with numerous individuals across the internet reporting significant financial losses. What's more alarming is the apparent lack of transparency and accountability from Poolin, with reports surfacing of individuals being banned from their Telegram channel for merely seeking answers regarding these issues. Furthermore, the mainstream media's silence on Poolin's activities exacerbates the frustration and confusion of thousands of affected users who are desperately seeking answers and restitution.

As cryptocurrency journalists dedicated to upholding integrity and transparency within the industry, we implore you to investigate this matter thoroughly. Shedding light on Poolin's practices, the extent of the impact on affected users, and the lack of accountability is essential in ensuring justice for those who have suffered financial harm. Your investigative reporting can play a crucial role in holding Poolin accountable for its actions and providing much-needed clarity and resolution to the affected individuals.

Based on my analysis, I'd say this post is **relevant to Bitcoin news**. Here's why:

1. The OP (original poster) is asking a question about the potential vulnerabilities of Bitcoin, which is a key aspect of cryptocurrency discussions.
2. The topic of ""how can Bitcoin be destroyed"" is a legitimate concern in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrency discussions, as it relates to the durability and resilience of the Bitcoin network.

While some might argue that this post is more of a curiosity-driven inquiry than a news-worthy event, I believe it's still relevant to the broader conversation around Bitcoin and its potential risks."

After mining with a few gpus in the last years, I am dipping my toes in BTC mining with an S21. I plan to host it first and install it in my new home (moving next summer) to heat up my basement next winter. I live in Canada so the effective electrical cost would be close to zero for half the year has I am running an electrical furnace to heat up the house anyways.

I have experience in electronics (mostly) and electrical circuits but I will hire a professional so the outlet installation is up to norms.

This is where my question start, please feel free to correct anything wrong : 

- As I understand, the 240v will be created from 2x120v phases. The pratical effect is that there is no ""line"" but two ""hot"" wires. Usually, the line wire  has the same voltage as the ground. I suppose it is expecting [240v, line, ground] while it will receive [120v, 120v, ground]. Could this cause an issue with the miner power supply ?


- My plan is to use a NEMA 6-20r socket. Then, I would need a 6-20p to IEC C19 cable to connect to the C20 plug included with the miner. I see that most people use PDUs. However, with only one miner, I am not sure it is relevant. Can you confirm/infirm?

Thanks in advance for your inputs.

Happy mining to y'all !

I have a lot more to learn, but wanted to run a scenario by this group. 

I have about $2500 in bitcoin in Venmo. I bought it for fun curiosity when I saw Venmo was offering it. I now know Venmo is an exchange. I presume then it also acts like a hot / custodial wallet? But I could be wrong. I downloaded Blue and Green apps on my iphone. My thought was to transfer the bitcoin from Venmo to one of these wallets. But I’m not sure how different they are from Venmo. I know not to buy bitcoin from a wallet. Is this like the middle step between Venmo and a hard wallet? I think I can make a non-custodial wallet in Blue.

Upon advice from this group, I’ll be buying a hard wallet too. Either Trezor or Jade (as recommended in FAQ). I’m presuming they’ll be compatible with Blue or Green? 

Or do I just buy the hard cold wallet now and skip the app wallet and just transfer straight from Venmo? Should I keep Venmo as a means to purchase bitcoin from their exchange, move it to a non-custodial wallet at regular intervals (monthly, etc) and then move it all to hard wallet once the balance has reached a certain point? 

Related question: I have about $15k in stocks that I was thinking of cashing out and buying more bitcoin for the long haul. The stocks are about 1/2 S&P Index and 1/2 various others ( Netflix, etc). It may be wise to keep the S&P, maybe not. 

I do have about $150k in 401k and IRA accounts, so bitcoin would not be my only investment if I did this. 

My main goals are to 1. Keep the $ safe and 2. Do this as anonymously as possible. 

I also plan to set up regular interval transfers (sorry I forget the fancy acronym for this), but someone suggested $1 a day or whatnot. Would I keep Venmo for this purpose? Or use another app?

I backtested some DCA strategies from past performance and i really cant tell, which time option is the most efficient one?

Buy BTC 66$ per day?
Buy BTC 500$ per week?
Buy BTC 1000$ per two weeks?
Buy BTC 2000$ per month?

Anyone else made such a plan and can give me some helpfull insights?

Thank you very much!

97,1bw1dh2,what is the long-term benefit of Bitcoin?,"hey all, total newbie here, but i'm learning a lot and loving the Bitcoin technology. it seems that aside from tech innovation and considerations, a large majority of investors are in it for financial gains (getting rich in $$$ fiat, they'd gladly trade all BTC they had if they could cash out $10,000,000 in USD today, and it's reasonable from that standpoint).  
  
with that in mind - i'm struggling to understand really long-term incentive for Bitcoin. specifically:  
- what would happen if **most people** put **most of existing money** in Bitcoin?? think long-term - like **50 or 100 years from now.**  
  
at one point - there would be no incentive for others to join in and invest. they would never see a 10x return. not even a 2x return. and how could they. 

i understand that ""early investors"" would get rich, and that's great for all of us HODLERs, but if we knew there is not a lot of money left in the world to invest - eventually we'll reach flat growth - and really - there is no incentive for future generations to invest anything.  does that make sense?

it feels kinda like an MLM - as long as there are new players coming in and pouring money in the system - it's great for everybody, but at point of saturation - the curtain falls, and the new younger generations will be pissed, everybody will want to create forks, or invest in shit-coins. i mean i get it. 

so how do we explain that? i'll continue investing and holding, but it is a good question, and as a beginner in the space - i don't have a really good answer. it's not realistic to say ""BTC will grow forever"", because at one point if all countries invest all of their money into BTC - it's not even a ""reserve currency"", it'd be ""global currency"", and that doesn't seem viable for many reasons (different taxation policies, different structural configurations of countries, different welfare and social systems, etc). far too complex to narrow it down to a digital currency, even if it's the only true ""digital gold"".

100,1bwwx1y,S21 home garage mining/heating setup,"Hey everyone 

Just thought I'd post up my first mining setup adventure. 

Has taken me around 15 hrs to complete! 

I'm not affiliated with any companies but will mention  what parts and where for anyone interested .

Ok it all started by getting scammed by asickings.com so dont try and buy a miner from them the dirty dogs! 

I got the antminer s21 from Scott at 805cryptoservices off reddit. I can confirm he is legit. Thanks for the easy good business Scott!

I got the nakamoto mining inlet and exhaust shrouds. Beautiful product and easy to fit. 
Removed the stock fans. Leaving  the power supply fans installed.  I got their njord board for spoofing the fans and as an automatic fan controller.  And also their 200mm ducting mesh filter screens. All beautiful products . And otto there was very helpful and awesome! Thanks otto! 

I purchased locally a 8"" ac infinity cloudline t8 inline fan. Which simply plugs into the njord board with a USB c cable and power from the wall socket.  These fans are loud like a hurricane lol 

Mounted the fan straight to the nakamoto inlet shroud. The njord board installs to where the factory fans unplugged from. 

I utilised an old shelf thing I had. Turned it into a big wooden box on legs which will  be insulated for noise and heat then fitted the s21 inside. 
Cut holes in both ends and routed 8"" r 1.0 double insulated acoustic ducting.
 
Am unsure if I will need to vent the actual wooden box of excess heat. But all good so far! 
 
On the inlet side I have set it up with a thermostat I had lying around and a electronic y ducting damper fitting. So if the air gets to cold the damper switches to drawing air from inside the shed instead of outside.  (Am a little worried about condensation in the miner during the -5 deg Celsius nights)  and when it heats back up it switches back to outside air. I have set this to switch at 5 deg c for now. 

I also got an h vac filter box and installed on the inlet to clean up the air.  Unsure if this filter has enough flow. As I can tell air flow has slowed some.  So may upgrade to a higher flow unit before summer! 

On the exhaust side I have set it up with another electronic damper y and thermostat setup . 

It will heat my gym to the desired temp then switch and dump the hot air outside!  And my daughter uses the excess heat from the gym to heat her hut. :) 

I setup a 20 amp submain circut specifically for the s21  . With rcd and surge protection.

The setup is drawing approx 16.5 amps 

All plumbed, built and wired by myself. 

Has been a fun journey lots learnt.

In hind sight I wish I had made the inlet side of the fresh air to the s21 in 10"" instead of 8""

May be another upgrade before summer. But for now coming into winter I wii just let it run. 

Next mission is heat my work shop in the same way!

Does anybody know why they would have a problem with verification? I could easily provide other means of verifying my identity if they asked.

Update: After a month, they let me resubmit my verification. This time, I realized that the problem might be caused by the fact that my credit checks are frozen with the 3 credit reporting agencies. I unfroze my accounts and tried to verify again, and this time it worked.

162,1c9gvxg,A direct influence from the halving on price appreciation?,"I have never seen an argument that the halving directly supports price appreciation but there is at least one direct mechanism. It may be insignificant but it’s real and obvious. I finally orange-pilled myself (got conviction) when I made this connection.

I have a miner and I spent $200 per month in energy to mine 0.005 btc before the halving. I’m basically buying btc for $40,000 per btc, which is a great deal. Compared to mining, there is a premium to buy bitcoin on the open market as should be the case. But, I would say it was ‘overvalued’ leading into the halving.

Just before the halving I was stacking 50% more btc than I would have had I bought $200 worth per month directly. It is rational for me to mine under these conditions. 

Post halving, my expectation was to become unprofitable as a miner. I expected to spend $200 per month to stack 0.0025 btc. Under these conditions, I’d be spending $80,000 per bitcoin. It would be irrational for me to spend $80,000 per bitcoin when I can buy it in the open market for $60,000. 

Now, the fees have exploded temporality and I’m making more mining profits than ever now but this is an effect of the runes launch and won’t last long. This profit discontinuity will occur and things will need to equilibrate.

When fees normalize, if price is still 60k, I’ll disconnect my miner and use my electricity expenses to buy bitcoin on the open market. Not only has the supply growth decreased and stock to flow increased, I will become a new source of demand for the more limited supply. To the extent that my hash power has reduced the network hash rate, my buying has increased btc demand in a real way. 

We know hash rate will decrease but people talk about it as if it occurs in a vacuum. When hash power goes offline, what is the secondary effect? The rational miner does what I will do: unplug the rig then buy bitcoin until mining becomes profitable. The analysis is the same whether the miner uses cash flows from some other activity (my job) to buy electricity or produces electricity (I have a small solar farm and sell energy to my utility). Some miners run on stranded energy and those will likely remain online and continue supporting the network because it is in their financial best interest to do. 

We don’t have to wonder if hash power will decrease in response. It will. The right question is about the flip side of that coin. My thesis is that most of the reduction in hash power ought to find its way into increased demand. What’s the alternative? Turn off the rig and stack fiat? Anyone who is into bitcoin enough to mine already prefers bitcoin to fiat. I’d be shocked if publicly traded miners didn’t choose this profit maximizing path, but I’m equally surprised I’ve never heard it discussed. This would explain why the production cost serves as a strong real-world support for the price. It’s not TA mysticism, but rational players with skin in the game. That is literally the point where miners become buyers. The beauty of the system is that it resolves itself naturally and quickly. Hash power decreases, which decreases production cost, at the same time bitcoin demand and price increase. The meeting of the two is the turning point for miners to resume mining (on average). 

And at the bull run peak, price radically exceeds the cost to produce, which should be about $80k once fees normalize.

This Reddit post discusses the potential impact of Bitcoin's halving on its price appreciation. The author shares their personal experience as a miner and how the halving affects their mining profits. They then extrapolate this to the broader mining community, arguing that many miners will eventually become buyers when their mining operations become unprofitable due to decreased hash power and increased production costs.

The post explores how this decrease in hash power could lead to an increase in demand for Bitcoin, which would, in turn, support its price. The author believes that this mechanism is a direct influence on price appreciation and is a natural consequence of the halving event."

Given the fact that as today I should earn 2k/mo  x 3years = 72k a negative 16k in profit after 3 years of mining. So only if BTC goes bananas I will be profitable? So mining is almost the same if not worse than hodling? While hodling, I can sell whenever I want, meanwhile having hardware in Ethiopia is quite more difficult to liquidate.

I hope someone can help me figure this out.  
I bought a second hand Antminer L3+ and have been running it for a couple of weeks through F2pool.  
I immediately changed the root password, and changed the existing settings so that I could mine through F2Pool.

  
However, every now and then I get an alert that it's gone offline, and when I check the mine configuration settings I see that the pool config has changed to some random Nicehash settings.  


When this happens I re-enter the F2Pool details and it works great, until it randomly switches back to the Nicehash details.

","Bitcoin miners play a crucial role in maintaining the network’s security and functionality by verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain. However, recent data suggests that these critical contributors are facing significant financial challenges. 

Julio Moreno, Head of Research at Cryptoquant, has highlighted a concerning trend: Bitcoin miners’ daily revenues have dropped to their lowest levels since November 2022, marking a troubling period for those dependent on mining rewards.

According to Moreno, the miner profit/loss sustainability index has hit its lowest point since June 2021. This index measures the balance between the block rewards received by miners and the increasing difficulty of mining operations.

If I have non kyc BTC does it mean I can transfer it into kyc if I needed to?

**EDIT 1: What I've learned**  
Thanks to everyone for advice. Even the snarky ones that are simply ""why ATM? Do your research"" - I thought I had, and this shows I didn't do enough. So I paid to learn.

Anyway, I learned
- I likely paid WAY too much in a service fee (around 30%) that I don't see on my receipt  
- ATMs are.... less than not great. They're*expensive* and a huge majority of them do KYC (know your customer), so they need your ID and eliminates any privacy.  
- p2p (Peer to peer or person to person) are the best way to go, but I need to do more research here. Since I don't know anyone IRL that even knows what a satoshi is, there could be some hurdles.  
- DEX (Distributed Exchanges) are probably the best way to go when buying (for me)... more research here too. Coinbase is suggested a lot, but I don't understand why they're the best... so yeah, research is needed.

I really like [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/s/SUbL8cc67I) because it gave some suggestions. I'm copy/pasting here in case it gets deleted:

I have a new IB (Interactive Brokers) account (on the Ireland ""branch"", im not from Ireland but I am from Europe). I have Cash account, default currency is USD.

Like its normal spot bitcoin right...? No futures or derivatives or whatever, just ""basic simple bitcoin"".



I saw that when you buy BTC through IB (im using the web user interface, not mobile and not the desktop app, just the default web interface) you buy via ""Paxos""... Im not familiar with them... Is it some sort of crypto exchange...? I know coinbase, bitfinex, kraken, okcoin, Binance etc. I never heard of Paxos... Is it an exchange...? Is it ""safe exchange""...? Like they (Paxos) buy and ""store"" (""custodian"") for IB, right...? What if paxos ""dies"" like FTX etc...?

Bitcoin miners' income primarily comes from two sources: block rewards and mining fees.

Mining fees hold an increasingly significant position in Bitcoin miners' income, with the current upward trend in these fees serving as a good positive economic incentive. The Bitcoin network has set a total of 32 halvings, with no coinbase rewards beyond 2140, and so far, only four have been completed. In the future, as coinbase rewards gradually decrease, aside from potential doubling in Bitcoin price, mining fees will also become a key indicator to compensate for the decline in miners' earnings.",Xinqiu-,7,0,7,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1csercy/how_is_your_btc_mining_after_bitcoins_fourth/,2024-05-15 07:07:21+00:00,BitcoinMining,2024-05-15,"**Yes**

277,1cti0gk,Am i thinking about this the wrong way?,"TL;DR: are public mining companies a decent investment or are they all fated to fail. And how much of a ‘threat’ are big energy companies?

Lately i’ve been heavily debating wether or not investments in public mining companies are worth it. My reasoning behind it being a bad investment is based on 3 reasons: 

1. There is no competitive edge in mining
2. Eventually the big players will take over (because there is no edge)
3. Bitcoin mining doesn’t scale (by nature it’s decentralized)

To shortly explain it:
I believe there is no edge in mining, you need cheap electricity, money to buy miners and some infrastructure to deploy them. Sure there is some marginal min/maxing but in the end every miner does the same…

So if all you need is money, energy and miners deployed why are the companies with more energy and money not deploying miners? And how fast will they destroy competition when they eventually do?

For example Saudi Aramco has 50x energy (55GW) 100x cash on hand (155b) compared to the biggest miner MARA (worth 5b in total).. Seems to me that if these energy giants (cause there are many more) wanted to they could each build out more than 200EH/s within give or take 2 years and destroy the profitability of all the current public miners.

Am i wrong to see this as an existential threat for public miners?

IF Bitcoin does one day gets to $1 million/BTC, and I'm working £'s so $1 mill is around £800k then would I be correct in thinking 0.1btc would be £80k, 0.01btc, £8k, etc...

ROI is great if you invested several years ago. ROI is still decent if you started today. But if so, whilst £80k is obviously a nice lump of money, it's ""only"" two years wage. It's not retirement-level money. Due to it's scarcity, if you do have 0.1btc and you're in the previously mentioned ""top x%"", is that likely to be of far greater value compared to fiat in ten years?

People keep saying ""we're early""... But how early? What's the idea as to the point where ""we're late"" ?

303,1d0jiv3,Crowdfunding Political Influence,"  Since the most critical aspect of mining Bitcoin is it's profitability and the main determining factor in profitability is electrical rates I decided to ask ChatGPT how to gain political influence over local government to lower the cost of energy so that more people have an opportunity to become self-reliant. They closer we get to free energy the closer we get to freedom. If the billionaires can purchase politicians at the local level then why can't we do the same thing? All money spends the same. 

So this is specifically geared towards mining operations in the United States that are suffering from high energy costs and low profitability and are in danger of shutting down. Only the publicly traded mining farms that are eventually going to be predominantly controlled by Blackrock & the gang will survive possibly turning the Bitcoin blockchain into the Blackrockchain so before that happens we need to
unite and change the policies that dictate electrical rates while also pushing for: 

Decentralized electricity, also known as autonomous energy grids (AEGs), is electricity generated close to where it is used, rather than at a large plant and sent through the national grid. This approach can reduce transmission and distribution inefficiencies and related economic and environmental costs. Decentralized energy systems are based on renewable energy systems and sustainability and can include:
Solar photovoltaic panels
Small-scale wind turbines
Batteries
Pumped hydro storage
Thermal energy
Combined heat and power (CHP)
Energy storage units
Electric vehicle (EV) 
Decentralized energy systems can also be more resilient and protect against natural disasters and cyberattacks. For example, solar-powered streetlights equipped with CO2 scrubbers can be connected to the decentralized energy grid to provide light and reduce CO2. In the future, piezoelectric kinetic energy harvesting could also provide an additional source of energy from within the grid by harnessing energy from people's footsteps on sidewalks or vibrations from cars on asphalt roads. 

In typical Reddit fashion I expect this will be downvoted and hateful replies will be sent but for those that are listening this isn't something that is impossible to achieve.

  To change local electrical rates, you would typically need to engage with local government officials and regulatory bodies. Here are the steps to identify the key players:

1. **Identify the Regulatory Body**: In most areas, electrical rates are regulated by a public utility commission (PUC) or a public service commission (PSC). Find out the name of this body in your locality.

2. **Research Commissioners or Board Members**: Once you identify the regulatory body, look up the commissioners or board members who make the decisions regarding electrical rates. Their names, backgrounds, and contact information are often available on the commission’s official website.

3. **Local Government Officials**: City council members, mayors, and other local officials can influence or advocate for changes in utility policies. Identify the local government officials in your area.

4. **State Legislators**: State legislators can pass laws affecting utility regulation. Identify your state representatives and senators.

5. **Utility Companies**: Understand which utility company services your area. They often have significant influence and may lobby for rate changes. Research their executives and public affairs departments.

6. **Engagement and Advocacy Groups**: Join or follow local consumer advocacy groups, environmental groups, or business associations. They often have insights into the political landscape and can guide you on whom to engage.

### Steps to Gather Information

1. **Visit Official Websites**: Look up the official websites of your local PUC/PSC, city council, and state legislature. These sites usually provide contact information and sometimes meeting minutes or agendas.

2. **Attend Public Meetings**: Many regulatory bodies and local governments hold public meetings. Attend these meetings to understand the process and meet key officials.

3. **Network and Contact**: Reach out to officials via email, phone, or social media. Express your concerns and ask how you can support changes in electrical rates.

4. **Public Records and Transparency Websites**: Use transparency websites like Vote Smart, OpenSecrets, or local equivalents to research the voting records and campaign contributions of officials.

5. **Community Engagement**: Engage with your community to build support. Public opinion can significantly influence elected officials.

### Ethical Considerations

While it is important to engage with and advocate to elected officials, ensure that your actions comply with all legal and ethical guidelines. Bribery or ""buying"" politicians is illegal and unethical. Instead, focus on advocacy, building public support, and making a compelling case for why changes in electrical rates are necessary.

We currently have this between several market ""wallets"" but I know that's not ideal for longterm security.

I'm looking into options for a better wallet, done some reading through this sub, and I see that obviously a hardware wallet is the best. Besides adequate security, the most important factors for me would be usability/interface (as I am not very well versed at IT/cybersecurity stuff) and price. For this, and from what I've read, I reckon that Jade or Trezor are my best bets.

Here's where it gets tricky:

We are very nomadic people and likely won't be settling into any kind of permanent living situation for several years, if not longer. (Could potentially still be 5-10 years away.) In the nearest of futures, we are planning to spend up to 2 years in SE Asia, where we will essentially be backpackers. She might do some online teaching and I will work as a dive instructor (here and there for some months at a time) to help offset our cost of living while there.

Given the nature of this lifestyle, I would not feel comfortable carrying my paper/metal seed phrase backup with me wherever I go. (Un-secure bungalows/homestays/rooms without safes and taking night buses, trains, flights, ferries, etc where all my possessions come with me.)

I can certainly find a secure place in the US to store my seed backup, but then the issue becomes: if my Jade hardware wallet gets stolen, I would need a trusted family member (a lesser risk) to pass me my seed over encrypted messaging (a bigger risk). I guess the risk would be somewhat mitigated by restoring my wallet and *immediately transferring all funds to a different wallet with a new seed*. But *then*, if I have to *create a new seed while in SE Asia*, I'm back at square one of having to either carry the seed backup with me or transfer it to a family member over encrypted message. Would using Signal Messenger for this, at least, partly reduce the risk?

I have a phenomenal memory, it's starting to seem like memorisation of seed phrases would be the best option...

Furthermore, is the 6-digit pin you have to set on the Jade hardware wallet the *only thing* keeping it encrypted? How is that an acceptable level of security in the case of a theft...?

Wouldn't a trusted software wallet (such as Electrum or Blue) with passphrase encryption be just as secure? And if not, why?

Finally, if I must go for the hardware wallet, between Jade and Trezor, what's my best option?

After analyzing the post, I would say that this Reddit post is not directly relevant to Bitcoin news. The post is asking about individual mining activities and opinions on the profitability of mining in 2024, rather than sharing news or information about the Bitcoin ecosystem.

352,1dfga2v,Unused electricity at my house due to solar,"I recently purchased solar panels for my home. Well I ended up buying too much and now have about 10kWh's a day more than I need. The problem is xcel buys energy back from you 1:1 if you use it (13-29cents/kWh). If you don't use it, they pay you out at a the low amount of 3cents/kWh.

So it's better for me to use it all.

I'm thinking of buying a Bitmain Antminer KS5 (20Th), putting it in my shed and running it as a pool miner.  Since the electricity is pretty much free, I don't see the down side and can make my money back in less than a year? Is that right?

354,1dfxbt0,Question about bitcoin vs gold backed currency,"Hello All! 
As I think about how bitcoin is superior to gold in many ways, and I see how govt fiat is toxic.
I have a question, or thought experiment. 
What are the chances/risks of a nation/brics alliance currency that is backed by gold coming to fruition. 
I understand that a gold back currency worked in the past, until it did not due to IOU's not backed by gold. 

my question is more addressing the concern of the majority of people that are uneducated on bitcoin to hop onto this new gold backed system as they are uneducated in the past. Now they have an institution that will stand behind it, whilst bitcoin is not. I as a bitcoiner will see past it, but I'm thinking of the majority who are uneducated on bitcoin.

375,1dmbwev,Extremely Disappointing Experience with CompassMining.io - Avoid at All Costs!,"We have been using CompassMining.io since January 2022 and our experience has been nothing short of a nightmare. CompassMining.io is a Bitcoin mining company where you can purchase your own mining equipment, and they provide hosting services for these devices. Monthly fees include electricity and hosting charges. However, our experience has been fraught with issues that have led us to write this very negative review and customer feedback.

**\*\*Terrible Customer Support\*\***

The support provided by CompassMining is an absolute disaster. Our miners frequently go offline, and when we contact support, it often takes up to three months to get a response. Regardless of the type of support request, we face weeks of waiting before getting any feedback. We own six miners through CompassMining, and since January 2023, not a single time have all six miners been operational simultaneously. Additionally, CompassMining frequently relocates miners to different sites, resulting in downtimes of up to three months.

**\*\*Non-Existent Monitoring and Service\*\***

The monitoring and service at CompassMining are equally abysmal, essentially non-existent. Miners suddenly go offline or operate at a reduced hashrate without any proactive measures from CompassMining. If we didn’t notify them, nothing would happen, and the miners would remain offline or continue running at reduced capacity. Upon notifying support, it takes weeks for them to acknowledge the issue and even longer to resolve it.

**\*\*Specific Incident with a Miner\*\***

One particular incident involves one of our six miners. It initially ran for only a few weeks before failing. We reported this to CompassMining, who took months to respond and eventually sent the miner for repairs. After several months, the miner was returned, only to fail again within weeks. We reported the issue once more, but months went by before CompassMining responded, only to inform us that the warranty had expired. They offered us the option to either decommission the miner or upgrade to a new one at our expense. This is ludicrous, given that the miner was operational for just a few weeks and was offline for more than nine months due to their negligence. The warranty expired due to their lack of timely support, despite our continuous notifications.

**\*\*Disparity in Service Based on Customer Size\*\***

For customers with a large number of miners, these issues might not seem as significant. However, for smaller customers like us with a limited number of miners, the impact is substantial.

**\*\*Prompt Billing Notifications\*\***

Interestingly, if you are late with a monthly payment by even a single day, CompassMining’s support team suddenly becomes extremely responsive, contacting you within a day to remind you of the overdue payment and threatening penalties.

**\*\*Performance Analysis\*\***

The attached graph clearly illustrates the abysmal performance and inconsistency of CompassMining’s services. The green line represents the expected hashrate based on our contract, while the red line shows the actual average hashrate per month. The blue line indicates the daily average hashrate. As depicted, there is a significant and consistent discrepancy between the contracted hashrate and the actual performance, with numerous and prolonged downtimes. This visual evidence underscores the reliability issues and the lack of effective monitoring and response from CompassMining.

Since the halving in April, miners' revenues have been cut in half.

Because of this, small miners are struggling, and the hashrate is centralizing. Bitcoin needs to pump quickly for them to survive.

Soon, only big corporations and governments will be able to mine. Just like the traditional financial system.

Controlling 49% of the hashrate allows transaction censorship. It's happened before, but people only noticed weeks later. Why is no one talking about this?

Buy the exact amount of BTC I plan to use from Coinbase, send it to my spending wallet, spend it, then report the buy and sell in this tax year.

I would like to understand if bitcoin mining could be proftiable for us, since we have a quite good electricity rate, for Europe. But when i check the most profitable miners, for example on this website: [https://2cryptocalc.com/most-profitable-asic](https://2cryptocalc.com/most-profitable-asic)

Then the most profitable miners seems to be for another coin Kaspa. My question is, why this coin is so profitable and how volatile is that? People who would like to mine Bitcoin, buy a Kaspa miner and exchange it for bitcoin? 

  
What i don't understand is, that there seems like an indefinite number of coins, and i assume every coin needs to be mined, correct? So these miners seems to be optimized on a specific coin or algorithm, but in the end, still everyone is talking about bitcoin, right?

410,1e1q58f,Can all wallets load my seed? (I'm getting confusing answers),"Helloy everyone,

Let's say I have a hardware wallet which has generated a seed. I moved my coins in there. Now the wallet is not working.

If I buy any other hardware wallet and enter the seed again, will it populate it again? 

I ask because some people were saying that MOST of the time your wallet will be rebuilt but not all the time...

They were talking about something *deterministic*.

Isn't this a huge risk if you enter the seed correctly in another wallet but your money doesn't show up there??

After reading the post, I would say that this is relevant to Bitcoin news. Here's why:

1. The post is about a specific topic related to cryptocurrency wallets and seed phrases, which are essential concepts in Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) usage.
2. It mentions hardware wallets, which are popular among Bitcoin users for storing their coins securely.
3. The post asks questions about the compatibility of different wallets with the same seed phrase, which is a common concern among cryptocurrency users.

Overall, this post is relevant to Bitcoin news and might be of interest to people who follow cryptocurrency topics or use Bitcoin as an investment or means of exchange."
411,1e1q8w7,Why hasn't this happened yet?,"Hello,

In my understanding,  it is true that Bitcoin's total supply cannot be practically increased. This is because the nodes will reject any increase in supply because people's holdings will reduce in value. Please confirm if this is correct?

If it is correct, shouldn't Bitcoin be valued a LOT higher? 

Most currencies apary from the USD are losing value at a frightening pace.

My native country's currency (Pakistani rupee) is losing around 30% of its value every year.

So if Bitcoins supply can never ever be increased, shouldn't it be valued near a million by now? 

I'd love your feedback.",namnoriiam,6,0,6,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1e1q8w7/why_hasnt_this_happened_yet/,2024-07-12 19:28:03+00:00,BitcoinBeginners,2024-07-12,"This Reddit post is not directly relevant to Bitcoin news.

Late to the crypto game and spent weeks researching this group and others as well as BTC news only to fall extremely sick and miss the huge dip in BTC when it was floating around 55k-55k a few days ago.

With it sitting around 62k and potentially climbing, is it smart to purchase in one go or DCA?I’ve always DCA’d in ETF’s but I know crypto is a different animal. For context, i’m looking to invest 10k. I use Coinbase and can sign up for a trial version of Coinbase One which would allow a free trade (saving ~$120 in fees) which makes me think capitalizing on this free trade option would be feasible. 

I’m convinced BTC is an amazing investment and would like to get in while the price is still relatively low. I’m also confident that with Trump’s upcoming speech in Nashville, BTC will blow up even more.

I have a room in my basement that is approximately 8x8x7 feet. I keep and breed widow spiders and need to keep the room around 85 degrees. I use a 1500 watt radiator heater currently but thought why not use that energy to create heat and lotto mine or maybe try out a pool.   I'm looking at antminer s9 right now. But also considering lucky miner or maybe the Avalon nano 3.  I would prefer to land near the $150 mark if possible.  

I prefer it to connect wireless, the room is about 50 feet away from the router.   

I'm happy to solo mine with bad odds that's not a big deal. But if there is a way to join a pool and actually earn a little bit that's even better. 

Anything I should watch out for when buying second hand? The local listings all seem to not know anything about the miners they are selling. They got them in a storage auction or estate sale. Which gives me pause on if they are being honest or just trying to pretend to not know they don't work.

470,1egxt3p,Advice wanted : Beginner ASIC solo miner with Avalon Nano 3,"Hi, Hope you guys don't mind asking for advice but I'm going to be a owner of 1 single Avalon Nano 3 and happened to be I'm going to solo mining first time in my life.

Now, I did my fare share of own research and watch ton of video in Youtube, I find it [Red Panda Mining](https://www.youtube.com/@RedPandaMining) to be most helpful.

So, I didn't get PSU from Canaan and instead, I bought this from Amazon instead

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFQGDH4M?ref=ppx\_yo2ov\_dt\_b\_product\_details&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFQGDH4M?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)

So soon as get a hold of mine tomorrow, I'm going to try if these and hope would be enough to run at least at medium settings until I get something better.

Lastly, I need a tips about choosing the right solo mining pool, Red Panda Mining stated that going BCH is probably is the best choice with Nano 3 since BTC is already on highest difficulty for solo mine and I doubt single Nano 3 would cut the deed.

Although, if anyone here solo mined other ASIC based coin as well, I would like to know if it worth doing it.

Such as LCH and DOGE for example....

So, when it comes choosing a solo mining pool, obviously I'm looking at [miningpoolstats.com](http://miningpoolstats.com) and first one to caught eye is [viabtc.com](http://viabtc.com) and it seem to be looked easy to get in to but I would like to hear what you guys suggest when it comes to choosing a right pool for 3\~4th is all you could do and what should I avoid or what should I lookin' to.

I never solo mined before, probably this part is gonna be most I need a tips to shared with.

Also, I hope it doesn't cost money to participate in a solo mining pool, I'm sure there would be a cashout fee involve just like Nicehash....

Thanks in advance.

UPDATE:8/2/24

So, PSU above are works, but like any other after market PSU it won't let you go to high mode and hash rate is stuck to 2.5th to 3th.

Also, PSU is crazy hot. Probably not good choice to begin with. So I just bent and ordered a 165W Dell laptop charger that everybody was talking about.

I might could return this PSU but not sure they want it back if they know what I used for....

Also, after the firmware update, once you establish your solo mining pool they won't let me change the pool afterword.

So I'm stuck on BCH Millspool for now.

Something have to do with password I guess... Will keep in post for you guys.

UPDATE:08/07/24

So, I got the Dell laptop charger and my Avalone Nano 3 is working in full potential.

Its been few days and no block was hitting what so ever.

I haven't change the pool settings after the password issue and I'm seriously thinking about switching to solo mining doge coin instead so, will get back to you guys on that.....

UPDATE:09/04/24

DO NOT BUY DELL LAPTOP CARGER FOR PSU ALTERNATIVE

I learned that If you alternative PSU is not PD3.1 it could burned the chip inside that decides what PSU you're using and machine would not recognize any power source if that chip gets fried.

Canaan warranty would not cover the damage using alternative PSU and they encourage to buy PSU from their store.

My first Avalone Nano 3 was okay, I witched back to my old PSU I've bought initially.

They didn't work in high mode but when switch the USB C cable that comes with the PSU, I was able to put on high mode this time.

So, lesson learned. DO NOT F#CK AROUND WHEN YOU CHOOSING ALTERNATIVE PSU AND USB C CABLE.

Also, I've been solo mining BTC with Avalone Nano 3 for month, I don't hit block for jack shit.

Somewhere in comment for Red panda video mentions Avalone Nano 3 is not capable for solo mining too, I need somebody to confirm you could hit the block with this.

474,1ehnton,Noob looking for a few answers,"Hey everyone, I’m new to Bitcoin, but have been doing my research and I’ve decided to invest an amount I’m comfortable with, that I can afford to lose. 

I plan on just buying a set amount and riding it for 10+ years, and may invest a little more over time but I have my other investments and am approaching this as more gambling than investing TBTH.

I have a basic understanding of Bitcoin technology and the blockchain, the best exchanges to buy from, and the importance of cold storage.

I just purchased a Trezor Safe 3/Bitcoin only device for storage and am waiting for it to be delivered.

I purchased directly from Trezor as I am aware not to buy from any third parties.

I haven’t bought any Bitcoin yet, but plan to after I get a few answers from this post to help confirm some of the things I learned/clear up several issues for me.

Here are a few things I am already aware of:

1.     Use a reputable exchange like Coinbase or Kraken

2.     When I transfer into cold storage, do a small transfer to ensure the address is right

3.     If I F up, I will lose my Bitcoin forever

4.     Bitcoin investing is volatile

5.     HODL (Hold on for dear life)

6.     The blockchain is kind of like a big database of all bitcoin transactions

7.     I will have to download Trezor suite software to run with my Safe 3 device

8.     My trezor will give me a 12 word seed that I need to write down and keep secure

Things I need help understanding:

1.     Once I put my Bitcoin into cold storage, and I want to check my balance in a few months, do I plug my Safe 3 in, input my pin, and it connects to the Trezor software on my computer to show my balance?

2.     The 12 word seed that I am given, will that change if I decide to buy other Bitcoin over several months, or will I just be given a new address? I’m a little confused how the seed/adresss works each time I make a transaction.

3.     Is there a way to test my seed words before I transfer over all of my bitcoin into cold storage?

I'm mostly just paranoid about having my Bitcoin in cold storage and in ten years my seed words don't work or something stupid happens because I make a mistake, my Safe 3 doesn't work, etc.

  
That aspect just worries me so I want to make sure I understand everything down to a T before I invest.

475,1ehyxha,Passphrase question...,"Hello,

I have learned how the pasphrase works.

My understanding is that if you want to stay even more secure, you use use a passphrase with your seed words and keep them apart.

However, many people say I should only use BIP39 words for the passphrase.

Why is that the case?

Can't I use some random 6 to 8 words that I come up with?

Wouldn't it be more secure to have a passphrase attached to that wallet AND use at least 2 other wallets?

I decided to follow up on one. I seemed to be forming a business relationship with the guy. He took receipt of an S19 XP Hyd that I wasn't able to run locally and coins were trickling in on a mining pool. So I decided to scale up. I sent him more miners. I started with two miners, and he told me that their main site was full and he needed to host them with a partner company, but they only took miners 5 at a time. I should have smelled fish at this point, but I sent him 3 more. He replied saying, ""Oh, actually I need a minimum of 15 them."" I told him I could not afford this, so he said he could find cheap used units locally. I paid a (comparatively) small amount for him to purchase them on my behalf to get his ""MOQ"", and he promptly ghosted me and switched the original miner to his own account. So now he has my S19 XP Hyd, 5 brand new miners, and a bunch of money that was supposed to be for cheap used units, and the fund for my kids' university is dead in the water.

485,1ej1bs0,Liquid fees compared to Lightning (ideal for swapping BTC),"I've been testing the use of Liquid and Lightning wallets since some exchanges offer free Lightning withdraw (Kraken). I like the Aqua interface (i.e. ""spending"" and ""savings"" integrated into one self custodial wallet) but don't see the benefit of Liquid unless you're planning to only use it for spending.

As a way to get to cold storage but avoid the high fees of exchanges (most don't have a custom send fee option like wallets do) the Lightning feature of Muun seems better than Aqua (and better than manually swapping through Boltz or Sideswipe). Breez is a true Lightning wallet but the swap fees are high.

Here's some recent data from 4 wallets showing the cost to send BTC with swap fees included (and also the Lightning to Lightning if you are staying off chain).

Fees for sending 150,000 sats (Note:on Kraken exchange it's a flat 20,000 sats withdraw fee):

**Aqua** (can receive LN or LQ and swap within app)  
BTC = 865-1325 sats (15 receive + 410 swap + 440-900 send)  
LN = 425 sats (internally swapping LQ to LN)  
**Muun** (uses subs on LN-BTC send)  
**BTC = 573-675** (internally swapping any LN to BTC)  
LN = 745 (internally swapping BTC to LN)  
**Breez** (uses Boltz for send to BTC)   
BTC = 2361 (1681 is Boltz’ fee)  
**LN = 15**  
**Green** (no swap options, so just for comparison)  
BTC = 440-930  
LN = 15

My conclusion is that Muun is the cheapest and easiest to get to cold storage, just not ideal for sending Lightning, Breez works better for that. Aqua is better for Liquid (if it has a viable use? I don't know an exchange that offers free send through Liquid). And Green offers both Lightning (Beta) and Liquid, but no swaps.",CoolJoeLiam,8,0,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1ej1bs0/liquid_fees_compared_to_lightning_ideal_for/,2024-08-03 11:41:10+00:00,BitcoinBeginners,2024-08-03,"**YES**

This maybe a stupid question but I have not been able to find it so I though I would ask.

Also I haven't been able to find a provider that will accept bitcoin. 

  
I am thinking that if I could buy with crypto then give the address of a drop off location that's not my address then that is more secure than just getting it sent to you house.

Is it worth the hazzle to buy a coldwallet (i’m thinking Trezor 3), or should i just buy it on an exchange (i’m thinking kraken pro) and keep it there?

I’m in it for the long run and not planning on selling anytime in the near future

519,1eovswe,Easy way to be in Bitcoin,"I'm just an old-timer, done and do well in fixed income and stock investments. The whole wallet and storage thing seems like too much trouble and too risky for me. The easy way I play with bitcoin is very simple. In a brokerage account buy FBTC. It's so easy and compare how it trades against actual Bitcoin. Your cash goes into a sweep account that pays very nicely then when you're putting money to work you just have to sign in and push a couple buttons to make your trade. NO FEES!!!! I think you'll see FBTC performs much the same as Bitcoin. For added profit and fun I buy bitx, a leveraged fund that will usually move 2 times what Bitcoin does. The good thing with BITX is you can buy shares then sell covered calls against the shares you own. This locks in profit and usually adds a bunch of free money when the covered calls expire. I don't trust all these wallet, they can be hacked, disappear, whatever, who is behind them, but a Fidelity or Merrill Lynch account for example is insured and you can trust it will be there.

I had a question about bitcoin's buying power. So we see bitcoin's number go up relative to the currency we buy in, this could be explained by USD inflating. As fiat supply increases, price of scarce assets increase from that system.

Okay, now I want to look at the increase of buying power and would like to understand that mechanism of that. If you lived on a Bitcoin standard, so not judging the appreciation of bitcoin in USD terms but instead on the buying power increase in bitcoin terms.. what is exactly happening here?

I get that if i buy a steak with bitcoin today, the same amount of bitcoin 
should be able to buy the same steak in the future as bitcoin cannot be inflated.

My question is, some bitcoiners talk about how their buying power increases over time, so that bitcoin for 1 steak can buy 2 steaks in 4 years or so. What is the mechanism of that? Is it related to the adoption of capital flowing in? Is it related to how the market is naturally deflationary and we are finally able to see it from a bitcoin standard (jeff booth)?

547,1evk1cw,Any chance there's more bitcoin in this legacy wallet than it's showing?,"Hello, so recently I've been helping my wife retrieve bitcoin she's had in a wallet since 2015. I'm pretty new to this stuff so I'm trying to wrap my head around all of the stuff regarding bitcoin and wallets.

Basically what happened is that she had 11/12 words of her key phrase and I spent a couple of hours figuring out how to find the last word to fulfill the checksum. After some trial and error with different possible words, I finally found her wallet with her funds in there, about 1/10 of a bitcoin. Now it was a long time ago, and her memory is hazy about the whole process when she bought the bitcoin, but she swears there should be more than that in there.

So for some more details, she originally used breadwallet (or BRD) and from what I've gathered, it's a legacy wallet. I've loaded the wallet up on Electrum with the derivation path m/0' since that's what most people were saying to do for that type of wallet. She also made one purchase back in 2015, but in the transaction history, there's only one listing, but shouldn't there be more, like when the coin(s) were added to the wallet?

If it's just that amount in the wallet that it's showing that fine and still great, but I want to be thorough and make sure there's nothing else I'm missing. Is there possibly more in there that we're not seeing?

I sent a transaction on February 8th.  Then on February 19th, my wallet was emptied.  I have never put the seed online anywhere digitally. I still have the papers with me.

I am just very sad. I have no hope of getting them back, but perhaps figuring out what happened, so I don't make the same mistake(s) again.  When I log into my Wasabi wallet, I see that there was one transaction which sent all 0.81 BTC:

I am assuming it's not merely a bug with my Wasabi Wallet.

EDIT: The timing of the wallet drain is curious. My last use of the wallet was about 1.5 weeks prior to the attack, and before that it had been a few months. The balance in this wallet has been marching downward for approximately 2 years. The attacker striking on 2/19 leads me strongly to believe they achieved access on or about that date. Had they been lying in wait since inception of the wallet in 2020, they took a huge gamble and could have stolen a lot more -- it seems unlikely.

The post is asking about a hypothetical scenario where someone's internet connection goes down while solo mining, and whether they need to start over or can continue from where they left off. This is more of a technical discussion on the mechanics of solo mining and has little to do with significant events, updates, or developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Bitcoin news typically focuses on major announcements, changes, or trends that impact the cryptocurrency's value, adoption, or overall health. This post does not fit into that category, so I would classify it as an off-topic discussion."

636,1fbugzk,Canaan Avalon Nano 3 - network issues.,"I've owned the Canaan Avalon Nano 3 for about 5mths now, it's been running fine, no issues until recently.

I've got it mining via Ocean and check on it every day. 

In the last month it randomly stops mining and has to be reset.

Like this morning... 

It was running for about 3 days since the last reset which is the longest it's run since this started.

I check on the Ocean website this morning and it shows the miner as offline.

So I try and connect to the miner through the Canaan app, offline. Try the local ip address interface, offline. 

Look at the miner itself on the little screen and it shows it's mining, watt usage is up, th's it's mining at is up, has an ip address and no error message about not being connected to the internet and yet it's cool to touch, rather than warm when it is mining properly.

So I reset it and within a few minutes it's off mining again, can connect to it, it's warm to the touch etc and all is fine.

Its done this randomly over the last month, I've tried giving it a static ip address, still the same.

I've even got a Bitaxe mining away next to it, no problems with it at all.

Has anyone else experienced this with the Canaan miner? 

I've tried looking on Canaans website but nothing helps and they're yet to reply to an email I sent a week ago.

The only thing I haven't tried yet is to look at any firmware updates. It had one about 2 months ago, so I might try and install the older firmware and see if it resolves the issue.

639,1fc37h7,Exchange? Wallets? Seeds?  So confused,"I\`ll apologize in advance for my question I know similar questions have been discussed. I have read a number of posts not only here but in other subs as well and still a bit confused.

If there is one thing that stuck in my head is ""Not your keys not your coins"" that I learned.

I am a total beginner when it comes to cryptocurrency and I do not own any - where are my questions;

Correct and if Im wrong and please advise;

I can buy crypto vi Exchange (coinbase, kraken etc) or P2P (bisq, robosats etc) My understanding based on posts here and other subs is that its easy to use an exchange. P2P is a way to buy without KYC which dont care if the government knows im buying coins also seems to be the consensus to be more expensive than buying using a exchange.

* I have been reading a lot of bad reviews about coinbase though. People getting locked out of their accounts as well as customer service. Are there any exchanges provide a ""decent"" service? 
* When I buy the coin, does it sit at coinbase - do I HAVE to use a different ""service"" as a wallet then?

A lot of my reading, I have also seen a lot of people scared of losing their coins after purchasing with an exchange and MUST move outside of there?

* Also a lot of discussions around hot/cold wallets. From what I learned it seems that cold wallets are more secure and I came across wallet caller Trezor (they are pricey). So lets say I buy crypto from Coinbase, should I then move to my cold wallet trezor? Lets then say I decide to sell, do I simple move my coins from the hardware wallet to the coinbase using some type of software?
* Personally I would prefer to use some type of software for wallet, but seems to be not secure enough. What hardware wallet besides trezor are you using?

I plan on buying small quantities, like $100/$200 often, my general goal is to keep for long periods of time looking for asset appreciation. 

 I started creting an account with coinbase but stopped half way because of all the bad posts around it. So looking for some general guidance of this community.

As a hobby miner who's been out the game for many years, I've come back and decided to play the Bitcoin lottery with the hardware I currently have. With this in mind I decided to build a Solo based 'pool' here in the UK due to ping times to others being in excess of 100ms+.

Pool infrastructure is based in AWS with a fast website for tracking stats in near real-time (whenever there's updates from the pool backend which are normally every minute).

There's a 0.5% fee which is the lowest I've seen around. The reason why it's so low is because I built it with performance and cost in mind (I'm an experienced software engineer and systems architect). It's all serverless except the pool/bitcoin node.

Website: [https://solohash.co.uk](https://solohash.co.uk)  
Fee: 0.5%

Feel free to hop into the Discord server for any help or queries: [https://discord.gg/kmqT48GtCF](https://discord.gg/kmqT48GtCF)

**UPDATE**: There is now a US based connection URL for low-latency to the pool.

# Low Difficulty (recommended for home miners):

EU: [solo.solohash.co.uk:3333](http://solo.solohash.co.uk:3333)

# High Difficulty (recommended for mining rentals/farms):

691,1fmpxq2,Help my brother understand (and myself) about hodling ,"I still consider myself a noob, please bare with me. 

All I do is stack, never sell sats or use sats to purchase anything, I'm thinking long-term. My brother, on the other hand, tells me if I ""profited"" from buying BTC, then I should sell to pocket the profit, wait for a crash, use what I pocketed to buy on the crash. This sounds like gambling and I'm not in to gamble hard. 

I bought in when it was 30k, bought more when it dipped at 16k I think, so he thinks it's a good move that I sell 1/3 of what I have now, keep the fiat aside for when it turns bearish, then buy again. In my mind, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't focus too much on what it's valued in USD, I look at how many sats I'm hodling. I'm thinking about BTC as my retirement so 20 to 30 years if I have to sell then I'll sell *then*, or hopefully be able to use BTC/sats for payments and food as normal as it is now to use fiat or a debit card.

721,1fpz7j9,Cold wallet,"Hi folks. Obligatory noob cold wallet question #9647.

I've been building up the sats to an amount I consider an amount I don't want to leave on an exchange/hot wallet.

I'm currently leaning towards a Trezor Safe 3 (no real reason why, it appeals and reviews seem positive). But as I haven't so much as held one yet - let alone use one, the question is quite how idiot proof/straightforward is the process from moving sats from Coinbase/Bluewallet to the Trezor (or other).

To avoid UTXO's, is the process easy and secure enough to transfer 100% of what's on the exchange in just one go, or would you still do a test transaction? Got about 75% on Coinbase, 25% on Bluewallet. 

TIA. ",Unknown,8,0,8,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1fpz7j9/cold_wallet/,2024-09-26 15:38:59+00:00,BitcoinBeginners,2024-09-26,"A Reddit post that's not directly related to Bitcoin news!

722,1fq033m,Seed encryption steal?!,"Hey guys,

finally got my first cold storage set up. I was wondering if I should buy only a cheap number stamp kit or waste some sats for an expensive alphabet one. My plan is to stamp them into these circular metal rings. Example: Instead of ""hello"" -> ""8 5 12 12 15"". It would also make it less obvious for anyone randomly finding it.

735,1frsmnf,"Beginning to consider looking into BTC, but have a few questions.","Hi there! I know the title seems very unsure, but gimme a sec lol.

Ive never really considered the possibility of getting into BTC, since once I was old enough for it to matter, they were thousands of dollars for a single one (and I stupidly thought you could only buy in wholes at a time). I've since learned you can buy them in extremely small amounts and just save up over time, and that's what interests me.

Firstly, I read through the FAQ on this page, and immediately got questions. It says before you invest ""Pay off any high interest debt and have an emergency savings fund"". Why is that? If I were only buying like $20 worth every week or two, why would I need to pay off any and all debts or have savings?

Second, I've looked into the difference between hot and cold wallets, but are hot wallets even worth using, even short term? With how prominent hackers have been lately, it seems like it would only be worth getting into BTC if I have a cold wallet on standby, but maybe I'm misunderstanding?

I also ask a friend who’s done this stuff before and he said “hey, she should be footing any electric bill it costs to run that 24-7” so I send her a text and she flips out that I’m sending the name to a few friends and how it will be stolen, and that it only will cost us 12 cents a month in electricity. Well, I don’t believe this. My friend did the formula math and believes it will cost $10.08 a month. So I asked her to pay for it and she refuses saying I’m disrespectful and her dad says it costs only 12 cents. Is she right or is my friend who has been mining for years the correct one? 

Any advice or knowledge on what I need to do is accepted! I also believe this is effecting my wifi and the cable box as an extra issue with it.

- Reset the wallet and restored from seed + pass phrase.
- Using my node, I completed a small test transaction out of the cold wallet to a hot wallet.

Can you think of anything I may have missed, or any possible points of failure in the future?

Also, I am currently using two exchanges. Exchange #1 only accepts the zpub address and uses a different bc1 address derived from the zpub for each transaction, while Exchange #2 only accepts a bc1 address. Is there any way to prevent the unwanted merging of funds from Exchange #1 and Exchange #2, other than creating a separate wallet? In other words, if Exchange #1 is using bc1 addresses 1, 2, 3, 4, etc... what bc1 address can I give to Exchange #2 that won't eventually be used by Exchange #1?

Would it be feasible to buy a second hand s21 or something similar and heat my garage with it?  How loud is it?  like really loud the existing heater isnt exactly quiet? Can you talk on a phone in the same room as it?   Could the noise situation be alleviated by putting in in a a partial enclosure with some sound deadening or not really?

781,1fzy1qg,"Is it possible to review a ""dead"" antminer s9se controlboard ?","Hi all,

I've been given a dead Antminer s9se controlboard from a friend to tinker with. Apparently power went out during firmware update. I've tried to connect it up to a serial port, but no output there. I've asked Bitmain support for help, but the model is too old and is now at EndOfSupport.

So far I've managed to put it in boot to JTAG, and is getting some information out of it using OpenOCD, At least when I list targets I get the two expected CPU's, and I'm able to issue a halt. Issuing an arm disassemble command in OpenOCD also gives lots of interesting output.

I suspect the upgrade process wiped out the memory and then power was lost, probably erasing the uboot bootloader from memory as well.

Now, is there a way to put u-boot back on it so it can be booted from the SD-card and restore the flash memory from that ? Have anybody tried this ? I expect that a regular version of u-boot will not work, but are there someone who have a version I could try ? Or instructions to where to find it ? He have several of these miners, maybe it is possible to download bootloader from one of these and write it back ?

785,1g0bg17,Who updates the Bitcoin Source Code with the new changes and improvements that are implemented?,"From minor updates to big changes like Taproot.

I asked to AI and told me that there is a process that has some steps. **But I have some questions...**

1. **Anyone can propose changes:** Individuals or groups can submit proposals for new features or improvements to the Bitcoin Core codebase. These proposals are often documented in Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs).
   * **Where are these proposals registered? Do they have to be in a specific format? Who receives them and controls the website where they are uploaded?**
2. **Peer review and testing:** Other developers in the community review the proposed changes, ensuring they align with Bitcoin's principles and are technically sound. Extensive testing is conducted to identify and address potential issues.
   * **Who are these developers? How many are there? I understand that they are not paid or working full time, so how do you make sure that there are no bad developers or proposals that are intended to cause potential harm? Where is testing done? Does Bitcoin have any kind of QA environment? If the code is open and anyone can contribute, what prevents someone from proposing senseless changes trolling?**
3. **Consensus:** If a proposal gains sufficient support from the community, it can be merged into the main Bitcoin Core codebase.
   * **How is community support measured? Who approves that the change is okay and certifies that it is good? Is there some kind of vote? Who decides? Who performs the merging of the new code into the Bitcoin codebase? Who controls the repository where it is stored? I understand that it is publicly accessible and is on GitHub, who presses the button to deploy a new change to the source code? Who has control of the repository to grant or withdraw permissions?**
4. **Implementation:** Once merged, developers can update their Bitcoin nodes to incorporate the new changes.
   * **What happens to nodes in the network that don't update to the new version? I understand that a ""fork"" can be formed in case of important updates, but in that case, everyone would have to update uniformly always, how do they agree to decide which change is good and which is not? Could a group of nodes organize a kind of ""protest"" if they don't like an update? What happens if the person who manages a node is busy or is not aware and therefore does not update? So all nodes are super informed of all updates day by day? How many nodes are there? I understand that there are several types of nodes, do they all need to update? If a node forgot to update and does it after days or weeks, what happens?**

If you read everything I appreciate it, I know they might seem like silly questions, but I've been checking and I can't find much information about the details of how this whole process works, people just blindly assume that the mechanism has no room for failure and that bitcoin is totally decentralized... but if the changes and revisions are only proposed and approved by a small group of people (developers), which we don't know, I even understand that some are part of a ""Bitcoin Core"" organization or are owners of websites like Blockchain dot com (I'm not sure if that's the company). Really all the people who have bitcoin are subject to their decisions, and to how the repository of changes is managed. Lastly, the nodes could also disagree on several things, because ultimately they are managed by people, and getting consensus for changes in large groups is complicated. I imagine there is an explanation for all this, I would appreciate if someone knowledgeable about the subject could answer it, thanks!

**TLDR: I describe the steps of the process of including improvements and updates in the Bitcoin source code and raise some questions (highlighted in bold) for which I have not found many answers and which everyone simply accepts with their eyes closed without many understanding how it works.**",Gonzalo12560,9,0,9,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1g0bg17/who_updates_the_bitcoin_source_code_with_the_new/,2024-10-10 05:07:18+00:00,BitcoinBeginners,2024-10-10,"**YES**

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Bitcoin the best because the creator is unknown and theoretically or suspectedly dead, therefore allowing the system to continue without interruption or any f*uckery? As opposed to any other coin where the CEO can theoretically control the value of he/she ever so desired?

810,1g45aum,Negative electricity prices - I get paid to use electricity - Can I profit from Bitcoin mining?,"Hello folks. I am a all in on Bitcoin as a store of value and as a means of exchange. I think I am ready to step up to running a mining rig or two. Here is my situation.  
  
1. I live in Brisbane Australia. We have an imbalance of the supply of solar and energy demand at the times when solar is most abundant - during the day. When energy supply exceeds demand folks like me, who use a wholesale energy retailer, get hit with what is called a Negative Feed-in Tariff (Fit).



2. A negative FiT means I actually get charged to supply my solar power to the grid. Or put another way I get paid to use electricity. It is not uncommon to see a -2c to -6c per kwh. I have seen it even go up to -8c.

  
3. My idea is to hook up one or two bitcoin miners and every time the FiT goes negative I just turn the miners on. Then any bitcoin mining reward would just be icing on the cake.

  
4. Napkin math time (prices in AUD).

Antminer S19 Pro chugging 3.25kW running for 8hrs for 6 months works out at about 4700 kWh. Assume average FiT of -$0.04 I would save about $190 in electricity costs over those 6 months.   
Setup costs: best guess about $3000.  
  
So my questions to those of you kind enough to be interested:

1. Is my plan practical, in the sense that I would have a reasonable chance of breaking even in a couple of years?

2. I would have to sell perhaps 0.01BTC to cover some costs of setting up. I suspect I would be better off (financially - in the short term) just buying Bitcoin and holding. However the money isn't really an issue, I don't really want for too much in a material sense. Are there other out there that think I have an obligation to facilitate decentralising the network by running my own rig? 

3. Any advice on getting in touch with someone that can help me get the tech side of things up an running here in Brisbane?",GiverTakerMaker,6,0,6,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1g45aum/negative_electricity_prices_i_get_paid_to_use/,2024-10-15 11:21:09+00:00,BitcoinMining,2024-10-15,"What a fascinating post!

After reading the title and body, I conclude that this Reddit post is relevant to Bitcoin news. Here's why:

1. The poster is interested in Bitcoin mining, which is directly related to the Bitcoin ecosystem.
2. They're exploring the possibility of using their home solar power setup to mine Bitcoin when energy prices are low (negative FIT), which highlights the intersection of renewable energy and cryptocurrency.
3. The post raises questions about the feasibility of their plan and its potential implications for the broader Bitcoin network, making it a discussion-worthy topic within the community.

I'm not proposing this, just stating what I wish I could do. But I will preface it by saying that it could be real, the numbers work. Here's the short version... Build 10MW of hosting powered by concentrated solar power. Open for pre-registration. If we got 10MW of pre-registrations, build it. You can call them whatever you want but the up front fee is $1400 per miner. In return you get 4 years of guaranteed hosting at $0.03kWh. Your $1400 would ROI in year 1 then you've got 3 more years at $0.03. I'd say if you were a founder you should be eligible for a 2 year extension at $0.04/kWh.  Your $1400 is being used to build the facility, let me be plain about that. It's also being used to get you the cheapest hosting on the market. Pre-Registration runs for 30 days. If the interest is there, the fees are due on day 31. You'd have to allow 2 weeks to get everybody to pay. Then 90 days later, we plug in miners. 24/7 monitoring. VPN. Foremen software. 95% uptime guarantee. All the goodies.

Now for my question, why does proposing something like this for real piss people off so much? Everybody benefits. Your S19 95T is profitable again. Why would proposing this lead to calls of scammer and phony? I'm not proposing it because I've been called enough names for one lifetime. But I would like to know why a deal that's really, really good leads to instant rejection?

877,1gkml0v,Seeking feedback: Just launched our Fleet Deployment Builder for Miners,"Hey r/Bitcoinmining,

I'm Deepak, one of the co-founders of [Hashbranch](https://www.hashbranch.com/). We're building tools to make Bitcoin mining more accessible, and recently launched a new product called the Fleet Deployment Builder ([Link to deployment builder](https://www.hashbranch.com/start)). It's designed to help miners, whether just starting or expanding, easily navigate deployment decisions, project costs and earnings, and quickly acquire what they need with a few clicks.

https://preview.redd.it/6u2qka1gk6zd1.png?width=1540&format=png&auto=webp&s=994d0b0726ab08f24ebb891a3aad131489a521c3

We built the Fleet Deployment Builder to solve some common challenges we saw in the mining space:

* There wasn't a simple way for customers to instantly acquire ASICs and rack space in one straightforward process.
* There was a lack of accurate and quality information that customers could easily access in a timely manner.
* Many miners struggled to obtain important financial mining and investment metrics to help guide their decision-making.We wanted to provide a platform where customers could feel secure about payments and have recourse if things went wrong.
* High-quality customer service was often hard to come by in this space.
* Customers didn't have much leverage to secure favorable terms or pricing for ASICs and hosting.

I'm genuinely interested in hearing from the community here—what do you think about something like this? Is there anything you wish tools like this offered that they currently don't? I want to make sure we're building something that's genuinely helpful for the mining community.

I'm happy to answer any questions or just have a discussion about the challenges you're facing in mining. Thanks in advance for any thoughts or feedback, and feel free to be as honest as you like—I know Reddit doesn't hold back!

878,1gkyzp3,[newbie] Solo or pool mining - what do I need to know?,"Hi!

I'm new to mining at all, I have a BitAxe about 2.5TH/s total. Trying to decide if I want to play lottery or join some pool (ie. Ocean or Braiins).

My question is about the solo pools - should I look at something else than latency? I believe that Ocean/Braiins may have better connection (faster I mean) to the BTC network and can be better optimised than ie. pool.satoshiradio.nl (live in EU so staoshi radio is closer to me than solo.ckpool.org). Difference in latency is 130ms vs. 40ms beetween them.

Am I right?

Does the pool connection to BTC network matters,  or the optimisation of the pool + latency is the key factor?  
And how do I know if the pool is well optmised?

2.  Do I mine BTC with these or are they more suited for mining a different coin that I can either hodl or convert to whatever?

Now that Trump is elected, he mentioned a national Bitcoin reserve for the U.S. He’s talked about keeping Bitcoin seized from criminal cases and potentially building up more as part of a strategic reserve. I’m curious to hear what you all think about this.

	1.	Why do you think Trump is pursuing this? Could it be a hedge against inflation or a way to position the U.S. as a crypto leader?

	2.	What impact might this have on Bitcoin’s price and adoption?

	3.	Could the government holding Bitcoin influence how it’s regulated or used in the U.S.?

Hope I won't be crucifixed for my question but I will try anyway!

Most of the time, I have read comments on here saying that Bitcoin is still the crypto to invest in, because it's solid, it's stable and has still prospects of growing.

Now with the Bitcoin reaching its ATH , how much would you think someone should invest in BTC to make it worth.

Of course depends on how much money someone is ready to ""loose"" and I understand that but in real terms, you people how many Bitcoins have? In particular those who invested in the last 2-3 years, how many BTC you have in your wallet currently?

In my specific case, to give some context:
I am a doctor in UK, so my salary is decent but nothing more than that. I have a lump of money I would be happy to invest in crypto, but this won't be more than £15-20k?
With this amount of funds, would you say it's still worth to buy like 1/4 of BTC or at this stage doesn't make sense anymore?

I am sorry if this question sounds stupid or has been already asked several times, I still hope you could give me your feedback about.

As I said, I understand the amount of money to invest depends only in how much I feel confident to loose £15-20k and never see them again 🙂

As part of our efforts to improve the community and establish clear, fair rules under the new mod team, we are **temporarily pausing all posts and discussions related to selling mining equipment**.

This decision has been made to protect our members from potential scams and to ensure that the buying and selling process is safe and transparent when allowed.

# What This Means:

* **Effective Immediately:** No posts offering to sell, trade, or purchase mining equipment are allowed.
* Violations may result in post removals or temporary bans.
* Discussions about mining hardware (reviews, troubleshooting, general advice) are still welcome!

# Why This Change?

The subreddit has seen a rise in activity, and we want to make sure that when equipment sales resume, we have solid rules to protect everyone involved. This temporary pause gives us the time we need to set those rules in place.

# Next Steps:

We’re working on creating:

* A **safe selling framework** with verification steps.
* A clear **list of rules** for buying/selling to avoid confusion and scams.
* A **dedicated thread or system** for equipment listings, if and when they return.

We appreciate your patience as we take these steps to build a better and safer r/BitcoinMining. If you have suggestions for the new rules or processes, feel free to share them in the comments below!

If a significant portion of the supply ends up concentrated in the hands of a few, what incentive would remain for common folks or smaller investors to engage with Bitcoin? Would this centralization undermine Bitcoin’s ethos of decentralization and financial freedom?

Additionally, the popular predictions of Bitcoin reaching half a million or even a million dollars make sense if everyone wants a piece of it. But if it remains largely concentrated in the hands of a few, how would it matter to the rest of us? Wouldn’t this limit its impact and adoption?

I’m new to crypto and have been seeing a lot about btc rewards cards. I’m curious but kind of skeptical because why would someone pick btc back instead of a regular cashback card with better rewards, especially when you just use coinbase or smtg?

Therefore, I was wondering based on groups:

•	**People with experience**: Is earning crypto really worth it, even with smaller rewards?  
•	**Newbies**: If you’re new to crypto like me, do you think this is a good way to get started?  
•	**Casual users:** For those not deep into crypto, does earning btc seem useful, or is cashback just easier?

Many people think that the value Bitcoin uniquely affords society can be easily replicated just because it is digital. I wholeheartedly disagree. The difference between Bitcoin and other cryptos is that all other cryptos are companies, while Bitcoin is a private protocol that cannot be actively managed by anyone. It is immutable. It has been running on the same base technology since its conception, and if you don't follow the rules set buy it's protocol, you don't get to keep the coins. But what's going to stop someone from making a ""better"" version of Bitcoin? Well, many have already tried and succeeded. Sort of. In fact, you can buy these coins today. But they are not Bitcoin. If you copy the source code of Bitcoin and change it, then you are just creating an entirely new cryptocurrency. It's like this: You can change the rules of chess, but you ain't playing chess. Changing the rules of Bitcoin would be like changing the rules of chess. Your version might be better (it's probably not), but unless you can convince everyone using the protocol to change the rules, it doesn't matter. Play by the rules and reap the rewards, or don't. Bitcoin does not care what any one person does. Thoughts? Can someone make a ""better"" Bitcoin and if they can, could that token catch up to the original?

1017,1gz67yi,Avalon Nano 3:  As a Noob This is Disappointing,"I picked up a couple Avalon Nano 3s off of ebay and I have to say I'm a bit disappointed.

Pros:

* Heat is nice and about what I expected
* Initial setup was straightforward
* They look pretty good
* On low they are very quiet, nearly inaudible
* Not sure if they got a special deal but if you leave the default username Braiins shows an FPPS fee of 0.5%.  I made a new account with Braiins and it shows 2.5% fee.  At this point I'm not sure how or if I can combine my two miners into one account and pay the reduced fee...something to research.

Cons:

* On high it is more like 60db as compared to less than 35 advertised.
* Edit: ~~Why doesn't the button on top control the mining speed rather than cycle through the display?~~ u/IamSixNine let me know double clicking the display button changes mining speed
* App (android at least) and web page manager leave a lot to be desired.  There is no scheduling, hi/med/low on each unit has to be individually adjusted, no power consumption tracking, no link to payout.  Fixed fan speed would be nice as the occasionally undulating tone makes it harder to tune out.
* I tried to change the password on the app which included using a generated password pasted in.  Unfortunately it appears the app has a character limit on passwords and somehow it got changed to something other than what I put in. Tried all the combos via the web login and no luck.
* I can't for the life of me figure out how to factory reset it.  Supposedly you hold down a button when you plug it in but it just boot cycles with no reset

**🚫 No Cloud Mining Posts, Comments, or Referral Links Allowed – Violators Will Be Banned! 🚫**

Hi everyone,

This is a reminder that **cloud mining posts, comments, and referral links are strictly prohibited** in r/bitcoinmining. Any content related to cloud mining will result in an immediate ban.

**What is cloud mining and why is it banned?**
1. **Cloud mining** refers to renting mining power from a third-party provider. While it may sound appealing, cloud mining often comes with high fees, unreliable returns, and the risk of being a scam. These services are typically not transparent and offer no control over the mining process.
   
2. **Bitcoin mining** involves owning and operating your own hardware (such as ASICs or GPUs) to mine directly on the Bitcoin network. This requires a significant upfront investment but offers more control and transparency.

We do not allow discussions of cloud mining services here, as they fall outside the scope of legitimate Bitcoin mining topics. Additionally, **if you share a referral link** for any cloud mining service or similar operation, you will be banned from the community immediately.

Please help us maintain the integrity of the r/bitcoinmining community by sticking to discussions about actual Bitcoin mining with your own equipment.

Thank you,

1050,1h1861i,NiceHash is scamming,"Anyone thinking of using NiceHash should review recent reddit posts here regarding how difficult they make their system to withdraw your earned BTC, in my opinion, with hopes you will give up so they can pocket it and supposedly ""donate it to charity"".

Like many others, I started receiving emails that NiceHash was now charging me BTC as some kind of maintenance fee for my account being inactive. NiceHash charges about $10 per month for the sin of taking up 1 kilobyte of data in their database. After two months I had noticed the emails that this was happening so decided to login and check on it. I had $315 worth of BTC (after $20 had been eaten by their fees of course).

I of course decided to immediately move the BTC somewhere less scammy but like all others, was met with 2FA requirements and KYC verifications to do basically anything on the account. Someone had mentioned that you don't have to do KYC if you close the account. I went down this route because I'm not jumping through their many hoops and pitfalls. I created a Lightning Network wallet to withdraw to and their system allowed me to progress all the way through to submitting the lightning invoice, and then fails because the account needs 2FA. I enabled that and then am locked out for 3 days before it allows any further actions. Ok.

Three days later I attempt the exact same steps again by going to close account which then directs to withdraw. Except this time, the account just immediately closes with the only message being an email to me that says the account is now closed. Can no longer login to it. Welp, where did my BTC go? Opened a ticket with support to be told that I ""chose to donate the BTC to charity on account closing"". LOL! What? Now they want me to submit a selfie holding a sign with my personal information like it's a reddit AMA or something AND complete the KYC process, to then ALSO charge me $10 as an ""administration fee"" to restore the account and ""recover"" the funds ""donated"" to ""charity"".

Nothing during this process states anything about charity. So it appears that NiceHash has this convoluted system setup to thieve as much BTC as possible from people that used to use their service back in its hayday.

1054,1h1cfsr,"New to Bitcoin and nearly ready to buy, wanted to check I am understanding what I need to do correctly!","Hello everyone,

I am new to Bitcoin and am nearly ready to buy my first Bitcoin. 

I am from the UK and want to buy £20,000 in Bitcoin. The steps I have taken:

1. Ordered a block steam jade. 

2. Ordered metal plates for seed phrase. 

3. Opened kraken account and made first deposit of £50.

My plan is to buy the bitcoin on kraken and then send a small initial amount to the jade, to make sure I am doing it correctly, before buying and sending the 20k. I will then split my seed phrase into two parts and store safely at two different locations, on metal plates. 

I wanted to check what I am doing is correct and that I am not going to make any stupid blunders. 

Am I correct in thinking that I can send directly from kraken pro to the jade? 

Is buying on kraken pro and sending to the jade quite reasonable in terms of the fees involved for my 20k? 

I believe on kraken pro I will be paying a 0.2% taker and 0.35% taker fee on my transaction? 

Am I correct in thinking my jade will create an address for me for receiving the bitcoin?

The jade will then hold my private keys and be able to use them in future transactions?

My coins will be safe unless someone gained access to my seed phrase or my jade and the pin for the jade?

I will create a pin for my jade at random offline using a drawing of lots system (picking random numbers out of a hat) and my jade will reset if the incorrect pin is entered 3 times? 

Apologies for all of the questions. I am sure I know the answers the most of the questions already, but really wanted to triple check, as 20K is a lot of money to me. So I just want to triple check everything and be as careful as possible. 

I really appreciate any help, thanks in advance!

I've been DCAing on BTC for a little over a year now, and I've been doing so through Binance.

For instance: right now I did a test in the Binance app and the current price of 1 btc was around 90250€. When I went to the convert section and tried to convert a few € into sats, the price of 1 btc was stated as being 90750€, even thought there were no fee costs on this conversion.

Hello r/BitcoinMining community!

We are excited to announce the launch of our **Mod Verified Commercial Vendors Wiki**, a new initiative to promote safe and trustworthy transactions within the Bitcoin mining community.

🔗 **Check out the wiki here:** [Mod Verified Commercial Vendors](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/wiki/index/modvercomvendors)

### What’s in the Wiki?

&#x200B;

* A list of commercial vendors verified by the r/BitcoinMining moderation team.
* Detailed guidelines on the verification process for vendors.
* Updates on newly verified vendors as they are added.

### Vendor Verification Process

We’ve implemented a robust system to vet commercial vendors before they are listed:

&#x200B;

1. Vendors must submit business details, proof of legitimacy, and customer references.
2. Moderators review all submissions and conduct independent checks.
3. Vendors who meet our standards will be added to the wiki with their contact and service details.

### How to Get Verified

If you’re a vendor interested in being listed, please reach out to the moderation team via modmail. We’ll guide you through the application process.

### Why This Matters

Scammers remain a challenge in the mining community. This wiki is a step towards building a safer space for buyers and sellers to connect with confidence.

We look forward to your feedback as we continue to improve this initiative. Thank you for being a part of our thriving community!

Happy mining,

1098,1h5fftx,Optimizing Solo Mining Strategy: High Difficulty & Quality Hashrate over Quantity,"Hello, fellow Bitcoin miners! I wanted to share my current strategy in solo mining Bitcoin and gather some feedback or tips from the community. Here's how I've been approaching it:

I'm running a setup with an average hashrate of 109 TH/s. Instead of pushing for a higher quantity of shares, I've focused on achieving higher quality hashrate and setting a higher difficulty. This approach, I believe, optimizes my setup to potentially catch more valuable blocks while reducing the noise of excessive, low-quality share submissions.

Here’s a breakdown of my strategy:

1. Hashrate: Maintained at an average of 109 TH/s.
2. Difficulty Setting: I've set my mining difficulty significantly high relative to typical solo mining setups. This allows for share submissions every 8 minutes on average.
3. Quality over Quantity: By setting the difficulty high, I ensure that the shares submitted are of higher quality. This means each share has a better chance of being close to or meeting the block difficulty, even though they are less frequent.

Goals:
- Efficiency: Reduce the computational waste that comes with handling a large number of low-difficulty shares.
- Focus on Block Discovery: With each share having a higher intrinsic value toward block discovery, the focus remains sharply on catching a block rather than merely contributing to noise.

I've found that this strategy, while it may reduce the frequency of dopamine hits from frequent share submissions, aligns better with the actual goal of mining — discovering blocks.

I’m curious to hear from others:
- Have you tried similar strategies in your mining operations?
- What difficulty settings have you found effective for your specific hashrate?
- Any tweaks or additional insights you’d suggest to optimize this approach further?

Looking forward to your thoughts and suggestions. Let's mine smarter, not harder!",juansansonjr,6,0,6,37,https://i.redd.it/c908u4m1ck4e1.jpeg,2024-12-03 04:41:11+00:00,BitcoinMining,2024-12-03,"**YES**

1100,1h5n0tm,Purchased first bitcoin and attempted transfer to jade,"Hi,

I purchased my first bitcoin for £50 today on kraken and transferred to my jade. This is the first bitcoin transaction I have done and am not sure if I have done it correctly.

It was my understanding that bitcoin addresses do not contain ""i"", ""l"", ""0"" or ""o"" so people don't make silly mistakes typing in the wrong address.

However when I went on the blockstream green app and created an address and confirmed it with the jade, the address had 0s in it and also a character that looked like a combination of an ""i"" and ""1"" I found this to be very confusing and when I inputted the address into kraken it said the address was invalid. I double and triple checked it. I believe I was trying to input the character as a ""1"" but I don't know if that is why it wasn't working.

So I then copy and pasted the address in an email to myself and then just coped the address from the email to the kraken sending address and it worked. I don't know if I have sent the £50 to the correct address or not.

When will I know if the transfer has gone through correctly?

How do I tell if this character is an I, L or 1? Without copy and pasting it in an email?

Is copy and pasting it in an email safe?

Sorry I am new to all of this, appreciate all help. Thanks.

Edit, I have an update. On the green app it shows the transaction as complete and it now shows my 0.00064248 BTC or 60.86 usd. It shows the received on address and the transaction ID. 

However when on kraken pro I click on the blockchain explorer link it shows fee sats $36.80 Fee38,736 sats $36.80  
38,736. Why did I still receive $60.86 if the fee was $36.80? 

Is it safe for me to share the blockchain explorer link here? Thanks.

1102,1h5s4ix,Is there a smaller unit than a Satoshi?,"# Assumptions

* Market capitalization of Bitcoin today: \~ 2 trillion dollars.
* Market capitalization of Bitcoin in 21 years according to Michael Saylor's presentation: > 200 trillion dollars.
* Today: approximately 100,000 dollars per Bitcoin.
* In 21 years: One hundred times more, so around 10,000,000 dollars per Bitcoin.

# Questions

1. A Satoshi (10,000,000 dollars / 100,000,000) would then be worth 0.10 dollars, right?
2. Do all direct Bitcoin transactions have to be divisible by this value, or is there an even smaller unit than a Satoshi?
3. How would it look in the further future if a Satoshi were worth 1 or 10 dollars?",SensationCookie,40,0,40,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1h5s4ix/is_there_a_smaller_unit_than_a_satoshi/,2024-12-03 16:59:16+00:00,BitcoinBeginners,2024-12-03,"A interesting post!

I'd say that this Reddit post is relevant to Bitcoin news. Here's why:

* The post is discussing the future of Bitcoin and its potential market capitalization, which is directly related to the cryptocurrency's value.
* It's exploring the idea of a smaller unit than a Satoshi (the smallest unit of Bitcoin), which is a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin's design and transaction processing.
* The post also touches on the concept of divisibility in direct transactions, which has implications for how Bitcoin's price might be affected by market forces.

Overall, this post is exploring various aspects of Bitcoin's value, scalability, and transactional mechanics, making it relevant to Bitcoin news."
1103,1h5uslk,How you would propose a strategic bitcoin reserve to governments?,"So I'm going to be potentially running for a seat in my local government in around 18 months and part of the selection process for the party with whom I will prospectively be running with is to come up with a proposal for the assembly that could realistically be debated, voted on, and enacted into legislation should the motion carry.

While I've already prepared a proposition (totally irrelevant to Bitcoin), recent movement among other world governments has led me to consider forming a proposition for a strategic bitcoin reserve. While I'm somewhat clued up on the benefits of a strategic reserve as a head against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currency, supporting/remedying government debt, etc, but i feel like these points alone aren't enough to form a strong proposition.

What are the key points you would make if you were to propose a strategic reserve to your government?

And for my own learning, what resources would you recommend I look at to broaden my own knowledge of the benefits or a strategic reserve and my knowledge and understanding of Bitcoin as a whole?

1134,1h8bk6w,BTC Mining Farm Insight,"Apologies for the redundant topic, but my circumstance is a little different than others I have read.  I see most of the advice is to just buy at spot prices rather than mine.  I am interested in mining on really any scale for fun/philosophical reasons, but would also like to assess the economic viability of starting a larger scale mining operation at this point.

  
I have a large amount of unused space inside an existing facility.  Call it 40k sq/ft.  Utility cost is $0.076 kWh and that could probably be negotiated lower.  The existing business spends $7-10k per month on electricity currently which is a fraction of the capacity available.  Noise and cooling are not a significant concern.    

Any input on resources to assess the above circumstance and how it might work in today's environment would be appreciated.  I'm looking for advice on whether it even makes sense at any scale, what kind of equipment would be recommended, what kind of capital outlay could be expected to generate a ROI in a reasonable time frame even if pricing declines substantially.

By the way I am a complete newbie and whenever I search how to get started on google I just do not understand with all the big words they are using and english is not my first language. So let's say if you would explain crypto and bitcoin to a kid or teen or young person, how would you explain it for them to be able to easily understand and get on the bitcoin wagon?
My questions are: 
What is bitcoin?

What is crypto? 

How much does bitcoin cost? 

Is it something I can put money into and it will grow? 

Is it secure and safe? 

Where and how do I buy bitcoins?

What is the process of buying bitcoins? 

Can I just download an app and buy from there and then it will grow?

Is bitcoin something like an investment?

If I put/invest £1000 will it grow in 5 years time?

If I put/invest/buy bitcoin for £1000 how much would it be in 10 years time?

Can I even put or invest money or is it more ""buying"" bitcoins?

What are the cons and pros to it?

Are there big risks to bitcoins? if there are, how can I tackle it?

Do I need to learn a lot for it to be able to get started?

Do I need to learn and understand certain big words like blockchain, hashing and block information and stuff?

Is it still possible to even buy or invest bitcoin nowadays? for young people?

How does bitcoin turn into ""money"" and can I easily withdraw from it and add money on it whenever I want like a bank card?

Is it worth investing/putting money into bitcoin? 

those are all the questions I can think of for now! Please be kind and understanding with your responses! I really am just someone who wants to learn and understand bitcoin and maybe invest in it without my head exploding with all the big words I see online that I don't understand.
I also want to be able to earn money and help my family.

1142,1h8s81o,Best Practice for Receiving/Depositing on Exchanges?,"Hi all,

See title for question. Essentially I'm wondering if it is okay to deposit/withdraw directly between exchanges and my cold (hardware) wallet? Or should I be using a middle-man? (Like some kind of hot wallet perhaps?) 

Further context: I have some BTC stored on Amberapp (Australian), and am looking at soon withdrawing it all onto my cold wallet (CCMK4), and using Kraken Pro into the future for buys/sells. I have already ran my first withdraw test by withdrawing a small amount of BTC from Amberapp to my cold wallet directly (through Sparrow), and was planning on then sending this small amount directly to Kraken from my coldwallet, and selling it for fiat as a test. Is this a safe method going forward? Or should I create a whole new seed phrase on my CCMK4 and start again using some sort of in-between wallet? I'm an average user with average-level privacy/safety concerns.

I will be working from 2025 August/Sep to 2026 July-ish, and I will have about £1500 monthly for me to use on whatever I want. 

  
Figuring that it would be good to understand cryptocurrency to a deeper level since it's not only heavily cs-related but also an investment-opportunity, I've got loads of free time until then to spend studying the subject to then invest into it later with what I've learned. 

  
Are there any resources that I can use to (attempt to) learn the field of cryptocurrency over this period of time? I've seen some online courses and wiki-links, but I suppose those won't really give me too much of an in-depth explanation. I'm definitely interested in learning the stuff that might not even be practical to an investment point of view, though I certainly don't want to miss out on the opportunities at the same time.

2. That smart contracts can drain your entire cold wallet? Is there also a risk if I move my Bitcoin directly from the exchange to the Trezor. Without any other programs?

1158,1h9rhwz,Looking for Feedback on My Bitcoin Investment Plan ,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 34M from Belgium, and I started investing earlier this year. My current portfolio consists solely of ETFs: 90% in global equity (ACWI IMI) and 10% in 3-5 year government bonds.

I’ve always been skeptical about Bitcoin, but after the recent post-election rally and reading this article from Banker on Wheels : https://www.bankeronwheels.com/bitcoin-in-a-portfolio/ , I’ve taken a closer look. While I still have some doubts, I’m now willing to allocate 5% of my portfolio to Bitcoin, making my allocation 5/85/10 (BTC/equity/bonds).

Here’s my plan:

I’m about to receive my year-end bonus, and I plan to use approximately €800 to reach a 5% Bitcoin allocation, I am still early in my accumulating phase. This amount is relatively modest, so I’m not sure if it qualifies as a ""lump sum"" investment. The rest of my bonus will go into savings.

After the initial purchase, I plan to dollar-cost average (DCA) €100 into Bitcoin every two months. This frequency helps me minimize fees : currently a minimum of €1 on Coinhouse, my chosen platform (the choice is not necessarily definitive).

My reasoning is based on principles from the stock market, like ""time in the market beats timing the market"" and the statistical advantage of lump sum investing when possible. That said, I’m not sure how well these principles apply to Bitcoin, especially with prices near an all-time high (ATH). 

Since my initial investment is relatively small, I plan to leave my Bitcoin on the platform for now. I’ll explore wallets (hot or cold) as my holdings grow and I gain more confidence in managing them.

As a beginner in crypto, I’d love to get your feedback on my plan. Does it make sense? Am I missing something important? Any tips, suggestions, or constructive criticism are greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance for your help!

1165,1hahuu9,Realistic Danger of Creating a Wallet on BlueWallet iPhone App While Online,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been diving deeper into Bitcoin wallet security and wanted to get some thoughts on whether creating a wallet while online (on an iPhone) poses significant risks. I understand the general philosophy of ""do not trust, verify,"" but let’s evaluate this in a logical way, I'm hoping it may also help other beginners evaluate the risk of each wallet, understand the differences and make their own choice. 

For context, I’m using BlueWallet as an example, but the question applies to most software wallets.

Here’s what I’ve done:

Created a wallet on BlueWallet while connected to Wi-Fi (iPhone online).
Wrote down the seed phrase and stored it securely offline.
Copied the wallet’s zpub.
Deleted the wallet and the app.
Re-downloaded the app and created a ""watch-only"" wallet using the zpub.
From what I’ve gathered, the primary concern here seems to be malware and keyloggers. But the way I see it, the seed phrase isn't being uploaded to the internet during creation, so what’s the actual risk?

I’m also considering iPhone-specific security: iOS has much lower malware risk compared to Android, and the app sandboxing seems to provide an extra layer of protection. Given this, I wonder if it’s worth moving my BTC to a wallet created offline after learning more about potential risks.

Here’s where I need clarity:
Many articles and hardware wallet vendors emphasize that creating a wallet offline (without an internet connection) eliminates exposure to online threats and prevents seed phrase interception. But when I break it down, it seems like this could be more of a selling point for hardware wallets. Given that I’m using an iPhone and the seed phrase is immediately written down and stored securely offline, is there still a real danger of creating the wallet online over Wi-Fi?

I’d love to hear your thoughts, especially if anyone has more experience or insight into this! Is the ""offline wallet creation"" myth overblown when using a secure device like an iPhone?

My Thoughts & Some Explanation:
I think the primary concern with creating wallets while online is the potential risk of malware, keyloggers, and other attack vectors that could expose your private keys or seed phrase during the process. While it's true that the seed phrase itself isn’t uploaded to the internet during wallet creation, there’s always a small risk that malicious software could capture it as it’s being typed or stored, especially if your device has been compromised.

That said, iOS is much more secure than Android when it comes to malware risks. iOS has strict app vetting and sandboxing, so the chances of malware affecting your iPhone are much lower compared to Android devices. If you’re using trusted apps like BlueWallet and taking basic precautions (keeping your phone updated, avoiding suspicious apps), the chances of encountering malicious software are very low. So, if your iPhone is secure, the risks associated with creating a wallet online while connected to Wi-Fi are relatively minimal.

One additional thing to consider is that BlueWallet is open-source and peer-reviewed, which means that its code has been publicly available for scrutiny by the community. This adds an additional layer of confidence that the app isn't doing anything malicious with your seed phrase when you create a wallet. With the app being open source, there’s virtually no risk of it secretly uploading or misusing your seed phrase, as any such behavior would likely be flagged by the community.

The key difference when creating a wallet offline is that it completely eliminates the exposure to online threats. If you generate a seed phrase offline, there’s no risk of it being intercepted via network traffic or online vulnerabilities. However, even on iOS, there’s always a small, theoretical risk when creating a wallet online — such as if malware were to somehow find its way onto your device (though this is rare). But if you're immediately writing down the seed phrase offline and deleting the app, the exposure time is extremely brief, so the actual danger is low.

If you're using a trusted app like BlueWallet, keeping your iPhone secure, and following proper seed phrase backup practices, creating a wallet online with BlueWallet on an iPhone is relatively safe. That said, if you’re particularly paranoid (and it's understandable to be), generating the wallet offline, on a hardware wallet or another dedicated offline device, would be the most secure route.

Ultimately, it comes down to your risk tolerance. For most users, creating a wallet online on an iPhone with a trusted app is safe, but offline wallet creation offers the highest level of security if you want to fully eliminate any risk.

Looking forward to hearing everyone’s thoughts on this!",Unknown,10,0,10,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1hahuu9/realistic_danger_of_creating_a_wallet_on/,2024-12-09 19:20:48+00:00,BitcoinBeginners,2024-12-09,"**YES**

They evaluate the potential risks of creating a wallet online while connected to Wi-Fi and consider factors such as iOS's security features, open-source code, and proper seed phrase backup practices.

The post is relevant to Bitcoin news because it delves into wallet security best practices, which is an essential topic in the cryptocurrency space.

1173,1hbak3r,Quantum Computers and Bitcoin: Should We Be Worried Yet?,"I've been diving into the topic of quantum computers potentially breaking Bitcoin, and here's what I've found: it's a real concern... just not for today. Quantum computers are still in their infancy. The best ones we have right now, like IBM's or Google's, are nowhere near powerful enough to break Bitcoin's elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) with Shor's algorithm. Experts estimate we’re at least **10-20 years away** from quantum computers being able to pose a real threat.

But here's where it gets interesting: Bitcoin isn’t just sitting idly by. The community and developers are already discussing **quantum-resistant cryptography**. Plus, simple practices like avoiding address reuse can mitigate risks in the meantime.

So, while the ""quantum apocalypse"" isn’t around the corner, it’s not entirely science fiction either. What do you guys think? Should Bitcoin developers start prioritizing quantum resistance now, or is this just fear-mongering?

I recently finally bought a wallet, the Blockstream Jade but already regret it as the setup feels ridiculously complicated to me.

And then when you pick some approach, there’s always parts missing in the explanation. So then I try to Google those things but I never know which approach the new video belongs to and if I am doing things in the right order etc etc. This is turning into a huge headache at this point.

What You’ll Need:
1. Casino Dice (you can use one casino die and roll it five times per word)
2. Diceware Lookup Guide (BitBox02 Diceware Lookup Table)
3. Diceware Instructions (BitBox02 Diceware Instructions)
4. Recording Table (explained below)
---
Recording Table Setup

Create a 25 x 9 table (I did this in numbers and then printed it off) to record the results of your casino dice rolls and coin flips. Here’s how the table works without the need for a visual drawing:
- Column A (Word Number): This column is simply a list of numbers from 1 to 24, in rows 2-25, representing each of the 24 words in your seed phrase.
- Columns B to F (Roll Results): For each of the 24 words, you will roll one casino die five times. The die must show a number from 1 to 4 (if the die shows a 5 or 6, you must re-roll it). Record the results in columns B to F for each word.
- Column G (Coin Flip): After rolling the die five times, flip a coin (heads or tails). Record the result in column G. This adds an extra bit of entropy to the word generation.
- Column H (Word): Once you have recorded the 5 rolls of the die and the coin flip, you will use the Diceware Lookup Guide to find the corresponding word. Write the word you find in column H.
- Column I (BIP39 Index): Each word has a unique index in the BIP39 word list. Look up the index number for the word and record it in column I.
---
Step-by-Step Instructions for Using the Recording Table:
1. Roll the Casino Die:
   
   - For each word in your seed phrase, roll one casino die five times.

   - The die must land on a number from 1 to 4. If any roll results in a 5 or 6, you must re-roll that die until it shows a 1, 2, 3, or 4.

   - Record the results of each roll in columns B to F for that word. For example:
- If the first roll is 3, second is 2, third is 1, fourth is 4, and fifth is 3, you would record:
- Roll 1 = 3
- Roll 2 = 2
- Roll 3 = 1
- Roll 4 = 4
- Roll 5 = 3

2. Flip the Coin:
   
- After rolling the die five times, flip a coin (heads or tails).
   
- Record the result of the coin flip in Column G (e.g., ""Heads"" or ""Tails"").

3. Find the Word:
   
- Use the Diceware Lookup Guide to find the corresponding word from the five rolls of the die and the coin flip result.
   
- For example, if your rolls are the ones above, and your coin flip is heads, you will write ""near"" in Column H.

4. Record the BIP39 Index:
   
- Find the BIP39 index number for the word in Column H by looking it up in the BIP39 word list.
   
- For example, if ""near"" is the word in the BIP39 list, you would write 1181 in Column I.

5. Repeat for the First 23 Words:
   
- Repeat steps 1-4 for the first 23 words of your seed phrase, rolling the die five times and flipping the coin each time.
   
- After completing these 23 words, you will have a 23-word seed phrase and the associated BIP39 indices.

6. Generate the 24th Word on BlueWallet (Checksum):
   
- The 24th word in your seed phrase is generated as a checksum, which ensures the validity of the seed phrase.
   
- This checksum word is calculated automatically by hashing the first 23 words. It’s best to generate this word in an offline, secure way using a reliable method or tool to ensure accuracy.
   
- The 24th word acts as a safeguard to check that the first 23 words have been generated correctly. It’s not randomly selected like the others but derived from the previous words.
---
Storing the Seed Phrase Securely:
1. Write down your 24-word seed phrase on paper. 
2. For added durability and security, consider using a metal physical punch seed storage system like CRYO or similar products. This protects your seed phrase from fire, water, and physical damage.
3. Additionally, you can laminate the paper and place it in a sealed envelope, ensuring it's properly taped to prevent tampering.

Why I Chose Diceware Over Coin Flip Binary

In my research, I considered both Diceware and Coin Flip Binary methods for generating entropy. Here's why I chose Diceware:

- More Entropy: Diceware with 5 rolls of 1-4 dice + a coin flip generates 264 bits of entropy (slightly more than the 256 bits from a coin flip binary method), adding an additional layer of security.

- Trusted Method: Diceware is a well-established and trusted method in cryptography. The added coin flip increases randomness without sacrificing verifiability or ease of use.

- Security and Flexibility: While the coin flip binary method offers exactly 256 bits of entropy, Diceware provides more entropy (264 bits) without being excessive, striking a perfect balance between randomness, security, and ease of use.

Conclusion

By following this guide, you will have created a secure offline wallet using BlueWallet on your iPhone, with your seed phrase stored and backed up in a secure way. The critical part of this process is protecting your seed phrase, and with the precautions mentioned (offline generation, secure storage, etc.), this method should give you 99.9% security for holding your Bitcoin.

Additionally, this process allows you to receive Bitcoin from anyone by sharing your wallet's address, and you can also send Bitcoin to the wallet after buying it on an exchange by transferring it from your exchange to your BlueWallet address. Just ensure that you never input your seed phrase into your phone again (or if you must follow the steps to be offline) after the initial setup and that it's securely stored.",Unknown,6,0,6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1he0t31/my_method_as_a_guide_to_creating_an_offline/,2024-12-14 11:12:54+00:00,BitcoinBeginners,2024-12-14,"No, this Reddit post is not relevant to Bitcoin news.

- Fastest Connection: 
  - URL: stratum+tcp://btc.viabtc.io:3333
  - Latency: 17.58 ms
  - This was the fastest connection tested, making it an excellent choice for efficient mining.

- Good Performance:
  - URLs:
    - stratum+tcp://solo.ckpool.org:3333, Latency: 24.03 ms
    - stratum+tcp://solo.ckpool.org:4334, Latency: 25.21 ms
  - Both connections to ckpool.org showed good performance, offering a solid alternative.

- Slower Connections:
  - URL: stratum+tcp://btc.zsolo.bid:6057, Latency: 173.46 ms
  - URL: stratum+tcp://stratum.solomining.io:7777, Latency: 180.89 ms
  - These connections had significantly higher latencies, which could negatively impact mining efficiency due to delayed shares submissions.

Conclusion:
Choosing a Stratum URL with lower latency can crucially enhance mining efficiency by reducing the time it takes for data to travel between your setup and the pool server. The results clearly favor btc.viabtc.io:3333 for the best performance. If you're setting up or adjusting your mining operations, considering latency can be as crucial as other factors like pool fees and payout structures. Happy mining!

I have some friends who own bitcoin on apps like RobinHood or Coinbase and the part that's making my mind scramble is, with how high bitcoin is right now, can people really simply just sell it for cash on these apps?

Like, let's say me and 4 friends bought 1000 Bitcoins back in 2009. We'd collectively have a total of approximately $100M. So if we all decided to cash in right now, would Robinhood or Coinbase (or whoever) have to just shrug and hand over all that money?

I assume there would be fees and what not. If the app pays out $100M, they'd have to then sell 1000 bitcoins to get their money back. Is that something that could easily be done? Is the market that good?

1235,1hfjyk5,First Big Investment Into Bitcoin,"Note: I used an ai tool to make this message more concise since I wrote it on my phone and English is not my first language.

Hey everyone,

I currently own about 700€ worth of Bitcoin. When I was younger, my grandparents gave me some gold, which is now officially mine now that I’m 18.

To be honest, I’m not a fan of gold as an investment. Its value feels inflated by the jewelry industry and by people’s belief in its worth. Sure, trust drives value for any currency, but gold has a theoretically unlimited supply. Huge discoveries could happen any time, flooding the market. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a fixed cap, which is one of the reasons I believe in it.

I’m a university student, and I want to sell the gold, which is worth about 5000€. Since I’m not exactly rich, this is a big chunk of my total assets. I’m not planning to spend the money—I want to reinvest it into Bitcoin. For context, I already DCA monthly into Bitcoin and don’t usually try to time the market. But in this case, because it’s such a significant one-time investment, I’d like to avoid buying at a high that might not be seen again for another 5-10 years.

I’ve also heard a lot about the Bitcoin cycle and how it might cause a market crash next year. I don’t fully understand how the cycle works, so any insight would be helpful. Is this something I should be worried about for my timing?

On a related note, is this sum large enough to justify buying a hardware wallet? If yes, could you recommend one that’s compatible with iOS? Or would a paper wallet be a better option in this case?

So my questions are:
	1.	Do you think it’s likely Bitcoin will dip to around 50k in 2025 so I could buy ~0.1 BTC?
	2.	Is Strike a good platform to use for buying Bitcoin, or are there better options for a purchase of this size?
	3.	Can anyone explain the Bitcoin cycle in simple terms and how it might influence the market next year?
	4.	Should I invest in a hardware wallet for this amount of Bitcoin, and if so, which one would you recommend for iOS?

I’m not looking for short-term profits—this is a long-term move. It’ll probably take me a few years, until after I graduate and get a job, to save up 5000€ again. That’s why, for this specific investment, I want to make the most of my timing while still keeping the bigger picture in mind.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts! And apologies for any mistakes.",DesperatelyAskReddit,11,0,11,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1hfjyk5/first_big_investment_into_bitcoin/,2024-12-16 14:12:40+00:00,BitcoinBeginners,2024-12-16,"A great example of a Reddit post that is highly relevant to Bitcoin news!

1259,1hhetxl,Couple of questions for my upcoming first purchase of BTC,"Hello everyone, 

I have a few questions to ask you and I would really appreciate your help. Btw, as pointed out in the title, I'm a complete beginner, so please do excuse me if some of the questions seem stupid to more experienced people out there.

Before going into questions, here's an overview of my situation.
I've decided to completely orient my finances around buying (DCA) and holding solely BTC (at least for now). I was a huge skeptic, I must admit, even though I liked the idea from the very start, but now having seen that the US allowed BTC ETF and that it's preparing further regulation and integration, I'm completely sold out.
I live in France and I've recently entered the workforce as a semiconductor design engineer. I have a decent salary (for a beginner engineer in EU) and safe job. (This will connect to my question). I've saved up for around 0.3BTC, and would invest periodically after this lump sum purchase.

Now I can go into questions:
1. What is the best way, currently, for an EU citizen to minimize the fees (transaction and withdrawal) regarding this investment strategy?

2. Regarding the hardware wallet, is Trezor Safe 3 a good choice? I would rather buy more BTC then spend on the wallet, but if there're more secure options then that's a paramount.

3. How does a software wallet integrate into this? How do you decide on the amount that's safe to keep there? What benefits does it provide, because if I remember correctly I can send the purchased BTC directly from an exchange to my cold wallet.

4. I was contemplating on taking out a relatively small loan, 7-10k€ at the 5.6% interest rate, in order to add to my first lump sum purchase of BTC. Accounting for the average rate of return for BTC, this should be very much offset, no? I guess with a huge influx of new investors volatility and ARR will probably decrease, but still it should cover it. Going back to the loan, I'm pretty confident in repaying it, although it would impact the periodic DCA purchases. Opinions? 

That would be all for now, any tips or advices that you've acquired over the years are MORE than appreciated! I'm no stranger to studying so if you have an interesting read that would be helpful, do share that link or post if it's not a big hassle to you.

I'm super glad and hopeful for this journey, for joining this community! Thank you for your help!

My parents have been pursuaded to buy solar panels after our Dutch government has made a push towards goin green.

To prevent having to pay, my father reached out to me to ask if he could instead use the excess power to mine bitcoin. However, I dont know enough to give him good advice.

I assume he would need at least the following:

New versions of the tool and firmware do not have this option but the newest version of whatsminer tool still shows the status of ssh which indicates that it could still be possible to activate the feature.

I am looking for any kind of help for this. Old firmware from 2020 would be a good start, especially a .img file that can be put onto an SD card. I also would be very keen to learn how to access the serial interface on the control board.

I know other maxis may think this is a silly idea, but I’m considering a “trial run” of living on a bitcoin standard.

For a three month period: 

-Receive half of my paycheck in Bitcoin via Strike, half in Fiat (fiat half still goes to normal bank account) 
-Continue to pay for daily purchases using existing credit cards 
-Pay bills (rent, utilities, credit card) using Strike Bill Pay / credit card
-keep my existing fiat savings for emergencies , extra expenses, and as a safety buffer while I adjust to a new standard 
-Keep enough bitcoin in Strike to cover 2x my monthly bills, the rest I send to cold storage 

Benefits :
-Ease into the feeling of not owning any “new” dollars
-Verify that strike Bill pay features work as advertised 
-Adjust my financial behaviors to more of a low-time preference mentality 
-Save a store of fiat that can be used for emergencies 
-Defer Taxes to 2026

Cons: 
-Not being “All in” 
-Falling BTC price in a bear market reduces my purchasing power 

“But why not just go all in?” 
Genuine answer: My ego 😂 I still feel the need to dip my feet into this before I go all in! This is a radical shift that my lizard brain is still trying to understand

1287,1hif64n,Home Mining Solar Question :),"Hi,

I live in australia, where elctricity prices suck badly...

  
I have a 10kw solar system , with an 8kw inverter. It's producing an average of 35kw/h per day.

My average daily usage is 10kw/h.

I'm feeding the remaining 25kw/h back to the electricity company at 11c per kw/h (roughly $2.82 per day)

My electricity without solar is .34c pkw/h  (overnight etc...)

So, what I am wondering, if I were to buy a Scrypt miner like : Fluminer L1 

[https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/fluminer/fluminer-l1](https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/fluminer/fluminer-l1)

Notwithstanding that it's new, and the company is not well known etc...  just using this as an example miner..

Would I be better off mining than selling my excess power back to the elec company?

And, how do I figure out how much of my spare electricity the miner would be using? (all of it?)

It's a bit overwhelming :/

Cheers

1315,1hkeqhp,Why I Believe Bitdeer Technologies ($BTDR) Is Going To Be The Next BTC Mining Prodigy,"TLDR: (human edited response from ChatGPT)

Bitdeer Technologies is leading the way in Bitcoin mining in Bhutan, where it currently has the exclusive rights to mine using the country’s excess hydropower. After partnering with Bhutan's government in 2020, Bitdeer helped Bhutan accumulate over 13,000 BTC, a key driver of the country’s economy. With its highly efficient mining operations and upcoming next-gen rigs, Bitdeer is on track to overtake major competitors like Bitmain. The company’s low-cost strategy and strong cash position give it a solid foundation for both current and future growth, positioning it to capitalize on the next BTC bull run.

———————————————————-

Alright, I’ll keep it short and rough. MODS PLEASE REMOVE IF NOT ALLOWED (I’m really struggling to find somewhere that will let me
Post this, so pretty please don’t remove) 

Firstly, I believe the value of Bitdeer's mining operations in Bhutan is often overlooked. There are only two organizations currently mining in the beautiful kingdom of Bhutan: the investment arm of the Bhutanese government (Druk Holding and Investments) and Bitdeer Technologies (which works in collaboration with Druk and the Bhutanese government).

For those not familiar with Bhutan, it's a small mountain nation in the Eastern Himalayan region. Its population is around 800,000 people, about 20% of the population of Los Angeles. It is currently one of three nations in the world that is carbon negative due to its abundant hydropower resources, and it was rated the 3rd most peaceful country in Asia in 2024, behind heavyweights Singapore and Malaysia (ranking 21st on the global peace index, just after Germany in 20th and Australia in 19th).

As I mentioned, Bhutan has an abundant supply of power from hydropower. In fact, Bhutan sells most of the power it produces to India — 75% of the total power produced, to be exact. In 2022, the Bhutanese government raised $9.53 million USD from exporting power to India, which works out to about $12 USD per citizen. That doesn’t sound like much, but when the minimum wage is $1.70 USD per day, that’s about 1.5 weeks of minimum wage for every citizen.

Exporting power is an important part of the nation's economy, but Bhutan has realized they must capture more of the end value of that power. Manufacturing is not feasible due to the country's mountainous terrain, and there is no heavy industry that could utilize the power. So, they had to explore other options.

And that’s where BTC mining came in…

The Bhutanese government (through Druk Holding and Investments) began plans to start mining BTC in 2019, with earthworks starting on their first pilot farm in 2020. This would allow them to generate far more revenue from their excess power, which is astronomically larger than selling it for pennies on the dollar to India. Later that year, in October 2020, Bitdeer announced a partnership with Druk to launch large-scale BTC mining operations in Bhutan.

Since then, a second, third, and most importantly, a fourth mine have been built. The fourth mine is significant because it was constructed on the site of a failed $1 billion project known as ""Education City.""
Education City was an effort to establish an international center for education and knowledge in Bhutan. For whatever reason, it fell through, leaving a heap of unused infrastructure that was prime for repurposing. This is where Bhutan's largest Bitcoin mine now sits. In fact, it’s so large that it consumes more power than the rest of the nation combined…

Through its mining operations (as of December 13, 2024), Bhutan holds a little over 13,000 BTC, or about 0.0165 BTC per citizen. That's equal to about $17k USD per citizen or 10,000 days of minimum wage for every citizen. It’s clear to see that Bitcoin has become a cornerstone of the nation’s economy (BTC price hovering around $105k.)

I believe this makes Bhutan one of the most attractive environments for any mining operation. The country has become increasingly reliant on the income and wealth generated by BTC. Bhutan even sold a large portion of its holdings at one stage to fund a 50% pay raise for its government officials, meaning the folks in charge should be in a favorable mood regarding future expansions.

The icing on the cake is that Bitdeer is the only corporation allowed to mine in Bhutan at the moment. It’s a win-win: Bitdeer provides the expertise and capital, while Bhutan provides the land, the privileges, and the PPA from hydropower. 

Secondly, Bitdeer is on the cusp of developing a rig that could place it in joint first place for the most efficient rig on the market. Additionally, Bitdeer has released a roadmap that shows plans to double the current efficiency of this new rig by the second half of next year.

This would make Bitdeer the premium supplier of Bitcoin mining rigs, obviously giving themselves first dibs on as many rigs as they want for self-mining before offloading them to external customers.

With power being one of the most important factors in mining, I strongly believe this puts Bitdeer in a position to overtake Bitmain as the market leader in Bitcoin mining rigs. The market size is expected to exceed $20B USD by 2031.

This also allows Bitdeer to rapidly scale its total hash rate, regardless of what happens to the price of BTC, as all their tech will be at the forefront.

Third and finally, the company continues to drive toward being the lowest-cost BTC miner and the premier provider of mining solutions. This is important because the company isn’t just another Satoshi stacker (hey, I love stacking Satoshis as much as the next person, but give me a second).

The company is focused on maintaining a robust and solid balance sheet that can see it through the lows of any bear market. Crypto is obviously very volatile, and all these companies issuing notes to buy BTC are going to be in for a rough ride if things go south.

If they do… boo hoo.

Bitdeer can continue driving toward doubling the efficiency of its rigs while leveraging the one-of-a-kind nature of Bhutan to get ahead of the curve for the next bull market. Its current cash position gives it a massive runway (as of writing this, no new plans have dropped, so they’re sitting on a stack of cash) and the company has an acceptable level of debt.

The company also has operations in the US and Norway, but I’m not going to waste any more of your time on that, as I don’t think there's anything particularly exciting to mention there.

In summary, $BTDR to the moon. As of 17 December I own 85 BTDR shares, representing 43% of my overall portfolio.

1321,1hksdwi,Not another cold wallet question...but kinda...,"I don't consider myself a beginner, per se, but I realize that I will never know enough, lol. Bitcoin, crypto, blockchain, UTXO, hot, cold, lightning, etc etc etc...it's all complicated...

Anyways...

Some subs/groups/forums seem to lean towards Trezor or ColdCard, Jade, Ledger, BitBox, etc. 

However, they/others also are AGAINST, some of those same ones. Is this a situation of just popularity in a certain group?

Ledger is a good example, some groups are passionate about NOT using Ledger. However I've seen Ledger recommend here tons recently which prompted my question. 

So is it really all personal preference? I do get the open source part of it, but with Ledger for example I'll read a post about how bad they are with their history and way their code is technically not open source and that you should use any of the other options, yet it gets mentioned a ton when people are asking for options (along with Trezor or maybe Jade)... and even when people aren't asking for options.

I’ve been considering getting into Bitcoin mining, as I believe the next 4 years could still be very profitable before rewards decrease further with the next halving. I’m looking to approach this seriously and plan long-term, but I’m facing a few challenges where I’d love your advice.

The biggest issue in my home country is the high electricity costs, which make mining unprofitable. That’s why I’m thinking of relocating my mining operations to a country with cheaper and more favorable energy conditions. I’m particularly interested in places like Iceland, due to their affordable and sustainable energy, or the UAE (United Arab Emirates), where electricity costs are also competitive.

Here are some questions I’d like to explore:

How do you set up mining operations in another country? Are there companies or services that assist with infrastructure and logistics?

What legal aspects should I consider, such as taxation, regulations, or operating mining hardware abroad?

Does anyone have experience mining in Iceland or the UAE? Or are there other countries you’d recommend for this?


Additionally, I’m trying to figure out whether it’s better to rent data centers for hosting the mining rigs or to lease a private space and build my own setup. What are the pros and cons of each approach, and how would one go about setting it up?

I’d really appreciate any insights or suggestions, especially from those who’ve tackled similar challenges or have experience in this field. Avoiding costly mistakes at the start would mean a lot to me.

It seems that anytime you want to buy crypto you have to pay a fee and I feel when saving small amounts, these fees negate the point.  

Is this just par for the course and something I have to accept or have people found a way of saving little by little without being stung for fees each time?

For example, I want to buy £10 or £20 at a time when I have some money spare and just see my bitcoin balance build up over time.  I want to do this way rather than saving huge amounts due to the (perceived) uncertainty of it.

1359,1hnmthy,ChicksX Market Brief: Miner Insights ,"The [**ChicksX** ](http://chicksx.com/)team here with a quick update on key Bitcoin metrics, especially those relevant to miners:  


# 1. BTC Price & Macro Trends

* **BTC Price:** Ranging around $94–$95K, up +124% this year.
* **Psychological Level:** Approaching $100K could spark major moves; either more buying or a round of profit-taking.

# 2. Miner Behavior

* **Miner Position Index (MPI ≈ –1.01):**
   * Negative MPI implies miners are holding their newly minted BTC rather than selling.
   * Less mining-driven sell pressure often supports a bullish market backdrop.
* **Puell Multiple (\~1):**
   * Indicates miner revenue is near historic averages.
   * No extreme financial stress or massive profitability event prompting mass sell-offs.

# 3. Network & On-Chain Observations

* **Exchange Reserves:** Slightly up, suggesting more BTC on exchanges, potentially ready for sale if sentiment shifts.
* **Long-Term Holders:** aSOPR > 1 & elevated Coin Days Destroyed show experienced holders are taking some profits, this can add supply to the market, but it’s not a panic sell situation.

# 4. Market Sentiment

* **Funding Rate > 0:** Derivatives traders remain net-long, expecting further upside.
* **Premiums:**
   * **Coinbase Premium < 0** points to softer U.S. demand.
   * **Korea Premium > 2%** highlights robust Asian retail interest.

# 5. Implications for Miners

* With **MPI negative** and **Puell Multiple stable**, the immediate environment suggests continued operational stability for most mining outfits.
* If BTC surges past $100K, expect hash rate competition to possibly intensify as new entrants jump in.
* Keep an eye on **exchange reserves**: a spike in selling pressure could weigh on price, impacting mining profitability.

# 

**Summary**

From a miner’s perspective, the market remains broadly **bullish**, miners are holding onto coins, and there’s no glaring sign of revenue distress. However, nearing $100K can bring volatility, so remaining agile is key.",ChicksX,23,0,23,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1hnmthy/chicksx_market_brief_miner_insights/,2024-12-27 19:31:27+00:00,BitcoinMining,2024-12-27,"**Yes**

1378,1hoyk2w,Newbie Looking for Advice on Starting Bitcoin Mining in Iran with $150k Budget,"Hi everyone,

I’m completely new to Bitcoin mining and recently managed to get a license to mine Bitcoin in Iran. Since I’m just starting out, I could really use all the guidance you can offer.

Here’s my situation:

* **Budget:** $150,000 USD
* **Electricity Costs:** In Iran, electricity prices are very low, which means energy consumption isn’t my top priority.
* **Goals:** I want to build a solid mining setup and will be conducting a feasibility study/business case. This includes finding the exact industrial electricity price in Iran.

Here’s what I need help with:

1. **Best Miner Models:** Which miners would you recommend for this budget? How many units can I get, and what’s the best performance for the money?
2. **UPS & PSU Suggestions:** What models would be compatible with the recommended miners?
3. **Cooling Systems:** If I go for non-hydro versions of miners, would I need an additional cooling system? If so, what are the best options?
4. **Internet Requirements:** Internet speed in Iran is relatively slow. Is there a minimum speed and/or bandwidth requirement for a Bitcoin mining operation? Does scaling up the operation require higher internet speeds?
5. **General Guidance:** Any other tips, insights, or things to watch out for as I start this journey?

I want to make sure I set up a professional operation that takes full advantage of Iran's low electricity prices while staying within my budget. Any help or advice you can provide would mean a lot!

Thank you in advance for your support.

1389,1hpjq4j,Title: Antminer S19J Pro+ stops mining after 20 seconds at my location but works perfectly elsewhere,"**Problem Description:**

Hi everyone,

I’m experiencing an issue with my **Antminer S19J Pro+**, and I hope someone here can help.

• **The issue**: The miner starts mining normally but stops after about **20 seconds**. The machine itself keeps running (fans spinning, interface accessible, etc.), but it no longer mines actively.

**• What I’ve tried:**

1. I reduced the power consumption to **2000W**, but the problem persists.

2. I tested the machine at a friend’s house, and it works perfectly, mining continuously without any interruptions.

**Suspicions and Additional Details:**

• I’m not entirely sure if the issue is related to my **internet connection** or my **electricity setup**.

• My internet speed is **25 Mbps**, which seems sufficient for mining, but I’m unsure if there are issues with latency or packet loss.

• My electrical setup includes a **20A breaker** and **4 mm² copper cables**. The voltage is **220V** and appears stabx

**Questions:**

1. Could this issue be caused by my **internet connection** (e.g., latency, stability) or **electrical quality** (e.g., voltage drops or noise)?

2. Has anyone faced similar issues with their Antminers stopping mining but continuing to run?

3. What tools or methods can I use to test both the **internet stability** and **power quality** at my location?

4. Is there anything specific in the miner’s firmware or settings that I should look into?

1. I don't believe (with good reasons/evidence) that BTC will become a currency. It is now more reasonable to think as a capital preservation tool. 

2. So far, i find that that depending on your region and banking regulations, both purchasing and receiving cash from your btc into your bank account has been proven to be an issue. 

Therefore, if i eventually plan to cash out to fiat, not being able to receive my fiat due to banking regulations/region restriction then poses a even bigger issue. As i am just left with the coins with no way to spend it. Which leaves me with P2P / Two way atms with 10% charges. 

  
All i am saying is that, for where i am , so far, buying bitcoin etf has been the easiest way. 

I found a way to buy crypto through IBKR my broker, but then i just don't know a definite way for me atm to cash our my coins in the future, be it the bank that will allow crypto transactions or regions where the exchange will work in. 

But then obviously, ETF poses a counter party risk too... phew.. been trying to research and weigh it out for days, some one please chime in on your thoughts.

Is that right? Just asking becasue the whole price action move today in total from Highest high to lowest low is £181.00, which would mean I would need a significant move to even break even...?!

I've had RH for years (I know it's a sin, but I've never had an issue with purchasing or transferring) and i would keep using it, but I've been doing research on the fees and it seems like their spread fee and ask price is a bit higher then the others. I downloaded Kraken Pro and River to compare. 

I put in a limit buy and RH had the highest ask price but did not show the spread fee or any fee within the preview page, I'm assuming it was going to be .6%. I can do recurring buys on RH. but I'm unsure of the fees. So with the limit buy on RH, even with the asking price being the highest, if it hit the limit order, i would receive the same amount of BTC if my limit order would be hit, as on Kraken Pro with their fee included.

I put the same limit order in Kraken Pro, it showed a  fee of .25¢ with a $670.03 lower ask price, so it theoretically should purchase before RH. I can not do recurring buys through Kraken Pro, but it can be done on the regular app or desktop with higher fees according to their chat support. 

On River they have a .99% fee, and I would have received the least BTC. Their app shows after a week there would not be any fees on recurring investments. But I don't know what spread would be. 

I am not a fan that RH had the higher ask price. And i have not got to the part of transferring fees with any of the exchanges, if anyone knows?

1441,1htjsyl,New to BTC Mining: Avalon Nano 3 Configuration,"Hi All,  
I am very new to Bitcoin Mining. I recently bought a new Avalon Nano 3 and set it up. Things seem to be working fine but I have a few questions. I have searched all over Reddit for someone else to have perhaps asked these questions but to no avail. Apologies if perhaps any have been previously asked & answered. Anyway, here are some things I'd like clarification on to anyone who has far more knowledge and experience than me.

1. My ""worker"" within the Avalon app is simply my BTC wallet address, correct? Should I be using a Coinbase, Sparrow or what kind of wallet address - does it matter? Also, do addresses go ""stale"", meaning if I put in my Sparrow address, should I update it like every few months or so?
2. If I want to use CK Pool to solo mine, what should my ""Pool address 1"" be? Would it be ""Stratum+tcp://solo.ckpool.org:3333"" - what does the first part mean? ""Stratum+tcp://"" --- I deduce that the 2nd part is simply the pool you want your miner to join (solo.ckpool.org:3333)?
3. Does it make sense to add a Pool 2 and Pool 3? Do I need a password for all of these?
4. In the wildly unlikely event that my miner finds a block, how will I know?
5. Is there anything else a noob ought to be aware of/consider?

I ask these questions because I think mining is a great way to continue to learn about how Bitcoin works. I have an Umbrel node set up and now my tiny miner is another way I can contribute in a small way to the protocol.  
I fully understand mining at 4TH/s is completely lottery mining and I'm OK with that so no need for someone to state the obvious.

I plan to do daily DCA on Binance using this recurring tool: [https://imgur.com/rwnaiGo](https://imgur.com/rwnaiGo). For example, $10 daily. Of course, I don’t plan to withdraw daily—maybe after I accumulate $1,000. **However, I’m not sure if, when I withdraw, I’ll receive a single UTXO.**

So, I asked ChatGPT, is ChatGPT correct? 👇

*When you deposit small amounts (e.g., $10 in BTC daily) into an exchange and later withdraw $1,000 in one transaction to your hardware wallet, the exchange consolidates all those smaller amounts into a single UTXO for the withdrawal.*

***Key Points:***

*1.* ***Consolidation by the Exchange***

*The exchange pools the smaller fractions (UTXOs) on their side and sends the total withdrawal amount as one output to your wallet. So, your hardware wallet will receive the full $1,000 as one UTXO.*

*2.* ***No UTXO Problems on Your Side***

*You won’t have multiple $10 UTXOs in your wallet unless you withdraw in those small increments (e.g., $10 each day). By withdrawing $1,000 in one transaction, you’ll get a single UTXO of $1,000.*

*3.* ***Why This Matters***

*• Having fewer UTXOs in your wallet is beneficial because it reduces the size and fees of future transactions.*

*• If you accumulate many small UTXOs (dust), it can lead to higher transaction fees when consolidating them later.*

***Tips:***

*• If you plan to withdraw frequently, consider consolidating funds into larger amounts on the exchange before withdrawing to your wallet.*

*• Always double-check withdrawal fees and ensure your hardware wallet address is correct.*",spatafore,6,0,6,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1htlj93/daily_dca_exchange_consolidation_withdraw_a/,2025-01-04 19:00:33+00:00,BitcoinBeginners,2025-01-04,"I would say that this Reddit post is relevant to Bitcoin news.

Like many others I’ve been debating to see if Bitcoins gonna bitcoin and take a large draw down. Everyone is super bullish on btc right now, deservedly so. But know one knows, some random ass event could happen and it crashes hard like in late 22. 

I’m confident it will go up regardless of the crazy volatility. Here enters the whole coin mentality. It’s a semi a rhetoric question. If I had the ~100k right now I’d buy a whole ass btc and sit on it for at least 10yrs. But the volatile history of btc makes me want to wait to see if it does take a large pull back. That way I’d have an actual chance at a whole coin. I know I’ve seen the memes, “ 20k too high I’ll wait 40k I’ll wait etc… 

This is a bull market currently, and typically not the best time to buy. The time to buy is when it crashes and everyone says it’s a scam. So I’m trying to figure out if I should just keep on plugging away at the dca game, or dump a larger amount all at once near an ath. Mostly to avoid the exchange fees/spread vs dca-ing. We don’t have cdc exchange here in the states. If btc rockets to 150-200-250k and up it will be out of my reach for a whole coin.

1456,1huhpyl,Need a 2nd opinion on Hash rate comparison and accepted shares. ,"Last week i read a comment on a Youtube video showing the bitaxe gamma (i think it was the gamma) and when someone commented about the Nano 3 the response was it has low share output.  This got me thinking so I did a little experiment at home. I have 1 LuckyMiner LV06 Around 500 Gh/s and 3 Nano 3 units.

During this lets say experiment I power cycled them all at the same time so the running time is 2 Days and about 30 minutes per unit.  
The Nano 3 units are on Medium averaging just over 3 Th/s per unit. The LM V06 does not show an overall average but its chugging along at around 500 Gh/s  I was surprised to see how many shares were accepted on the LM V06 vs the Nano 3 units. I am pretty sure i am wrong in my logical thinking hence why i am posting here. But it would take 6 LM V06 to get me 3 Th/s processing power. If that is the case then i could multiply the below number by 6 and that is what the number of shares i would think a 3Th/s LM would give me. Right?  Below are the numbers for the 4 devices over 2 days of hashing. Its actually 2 days and i think 45 minutes.

Shares comparison after 2 days on CK Pool.  
Nano 3 number 1 @  3Th/s  accepted shares 53,020 rejected 50  
Nano 3 number 4 @  3Th/s accepted shares 53,993 rejected 54  
Nano 3 number 5  @  3Th/s accepted shares 51,122 rejected 52  
LM V06 @ 500 Gh/s accepted shares 44,443 rejected 44

The 3 nano 3 units averaged 52,711 shares.  So im looking at a difference of 8,268 shares between a device that does 500Gh/s and a device that is doing 3Th/s  To me that does not seem right after 2 days of running.

Below are the stats from CK pool for the units. To me its interesting to see the best ever from the LM V06 is better than 3 of my Nano 3 units. Again maybe i am interpreting the data incorrectly or im just to new and dont have a good concept of what the number truly mean.

Also yes i know my chances of hitting a block are astronomical but i like the lottery possibility of winning a block so id rather gamble this way vs buying lottery tickets. LOL Plus i am enjoying learning about this technology.

1460,1huwtsr,How Would You Invest €5k in Bitcoin Today? | Reaching 0.1 Bitcoin,"**Hello fellow Bitcoiners,**

I have asked about this topic before and have now decided to commit to selling the gold.

I currently own some Bitcoin and plan to hold it long-term. As a child, I frequently asked my parents to buy Bitcoin for me, but they declined and didn’t allow me to acquire it by other means. This left me watching the price rise while being unable to invest. I don’t hold a grudge, but sometimes I wonder what could have happened if they had listened to me back in 2020.

Unfortunately, I could only start buying Bitcoin after turning 18 last year. I’m now a student and recently quit my developer job, which I held for 2.5 years during high school, to focus on university and other commitments. For the next few months, I probably won’t be able to work, meaning I won’t have any big / real income during this time. This is why I’m carefully considering how to approach this investment.

As I previously wrote: When I was younger, I received some gold as a gift, and now that I’ve turned 18, I have full custody of it. I’ve decided to sell the gold because I don’t see it as a good long-term investment. Its value is around €5,000.

Here’s my situation: I’ll soon have the money from selling the gold, and I want to invest most, if not all, of it in Bitcoin. Ever since I discovered Bitcoin as a minor, it’s been my dream to own 1 BTC. Unfortunately, with Bitcoin’s value rising much faster than my ability to acquire fiat, that dream is no longer realistic. My revised goal is to own 0.1 BTC.

Back when I first asked my parents to invest a few hundred euros, this would have been easily achievable. Now, it’s much harder. After some calculations, I realized that Bitcoin’s price would need to drop to around €60k for me to afford the remaining amount to reach 0.1 BTC using the proceeds from the gold.

I also invested in an ETF during high school (is that the right term? we call it “weiterführende Schule” in Germany). That ETF is now worth €2,600. Combined with the €5,000 from selling the gold, this would be enough to buy the remaining 0.0844 BTC I need to reach my 0.1 BTC goal at current prices. However, I don’t want to sell the ETF unless absolutely necessary so its not really an option for me at this point.

I’ve though about the whole topic for a few weeks now and came up with four different strategies for moving forward:

**A:** Take the €5,000 and buy Bitcoin immediately. It could go up or down in the short term, but timing the market is impossible, and it’s better to act early than wait for the “perfect” moment.

**B:** Dollar-cost average (DCA) over the next year by setting up an auto-buy feature on an exchange. This way, I can spread out my investment and hope the price dips during that period. I don’t like relying on charts or speculative patterns to predict short-term price movements, but this approach would give me some peace of mind. This could also be combined with something like option C where it would replace the second buy.

**C:** Use part of the money to buy Bitcoin now and place a market order for the remaining amount at a lower price point. If the price doesn’t drop after 1.5 years, I’d invest the remaining money into Bitcoin anyway and accept that owning 0.1 BTC might not be achievable. However, this strategy requires Bitcoin to fall significantly (to the €40k range) for me to hit my target.

**D:** Place a market order at €60k and hope for the best. If the order isn’t executed after 1.5 years, I’d buy Bitcoin with all the money and move on from my 0.1 BTC dream.

I’d love to hear your thoughts and advice on which approach makes the most sense, especially from those of you who’ve been in similar situations. Thanks for reading! English is not my first language so im sorry for any mistakes.

I know no one here suggests timing the market so you will probably either suggest option A or B which is fine. I think option C is an approach that would also be supportable by some.

This would then be saved on my cloud backup provider along with all of my other work projects.

Running some tests and at full hashing power the T8 fan is at 90% and the stock fans are still running approx 50%. 
Dialed down to half hashing, the T8 can be at 50% and the stock fans aren’t running.. its whisper quiet.  So my question for those that have done this. Is it better to just remove the stock fans all together to improved its cooling/airflow? My thought was that if the T8 quits for some reason, the stock fans would provide backup cooling. But now I’m starting to question this.

1513,1hy53sj,How do people fail to understand ,"

This is how I look at it , bitcoin is divisible and portable like cash and scarce like gold. It has the best features of both and better. 

Gold is great cause scarce so preserves purchasing power but you can't run a global economy on gold. We can't be shipping eachother gold for global trade, it's too slow and very expensive to secure and transport. 

It's also not as divisible as cash, like if you want to buy coffee with gold you'd have to shave a little flake and weigh it out.

Cash works because 80% of cash is digital , 
so it's highly portable and divisible. The problem though is since more keeps getting created it loses purchasing power.

Bitcoin is scarce like gold, in fact even scarcer , its stock to flow has surpassed gold now and lost bitcoin is not retrievable unlike gold which when lost will eventually get rediscovered since it's still on earth.

Bitcoin is more portable than digital cash. An international bank transfer takes 1-5 business days. Bitcoin takes about 10 minutes. Even faster with the lightning network which takes a split second then you can always do final settlement later on mainchain. 

It's even more divisible cause 1 bitcoin is made of 100 million base units called satoshis. 

It's decentralized , so unlike how banks can freeze your account and stop your transactions it's not possible with bitcoin. This was why canadian truckers started using bitcoin during the covid protests after trudeau froze there bank accounts. 

 Holding it doesn't require third party trust. 
When you put your money in a bank you trust they'll let you redeem it but in some countries governments have stolen peoples bank savings like lebanon. Bitcoin exists on a decentralized ledger that's immutable so nobody can seize it as long as you keep your private key secure. Aside from ofcourse threatening you and making you hand it over yourself.

It is like the perfect form of money , it has every quality we've wanted in money. Yet people

1516,1hy8bib,I'm more afraid of losing access to a cold wallet than access to my online wallet.,"I know.  I know.  I know.  I am going to get shit for this, but I'm being honest.  I'm most likely saying this so that I get told I'm wrong and it points me in the right direction, but I have to get it off my chest.

I lose things around my house all the time -- I'm not irresponsible, it just happens.  I have a safe.  I keep passports, birth certificates, etc. in there.  But from time to time I need to access those things, like a passport.  So I get them out and take them to the study when I'm getting ready to go on a cruise.  Then my kid falls down the stairs or some other instant emergency comes up and the passport sits on the desk.  Then I have to make dinner.  Then mail gets put on top of the passports.  Then mail gets shuffled to a counter.  Then 3 weeks later, I'm looking for the passports in the safe.  Then I'm like oh shit, where did I put those.  This happens.  What if I lose my private key or \[seedphrase\] this way.  Everyone has heard horror stories of the hard drive that got thrown away or the key or \[seedphrase\] that was misplaced -- what if those people had just kept an online wallet?!?  Maybe they would still have access and it would be a non-issue.

That's my fear of having a cold wallet or \[seedphrase\].  I know it should stay in the safe.  I KNOW IT SHOULD STAY IN THE SAFE.  Or it should go in a safety deposit box in a bank.  Well what happens if it somehow isn't there one day -- those boxes aren't insured.  What if it just goes missing!? Well, I should have multiple keys hidden somewhere shouldn't I?!  Well what if my kids find them, or I forget where they are, or ...or...or... I just keep thinking about everything that COULD go wrong.

My point is that, I'm more worried about that happening and I don't know how to get over it..  How wrong am I?  How likely is it that I will somehow get screwed by online wallet (not on an exchange) or hacked somehow?  I really don't know and that is why I'm asking.  Is it inevitable that I will get screwed if I maintain an online wallet?  I realize the answer is going to be who would I rather trust: myself or some app?.....anyways, rant over.

1. if I want to make a sell limit order at some price, am I correct in thinking my bitcoin needs to be available and sit on the exchange already? 

2. this means I need to sweep my paper wallet well in advance, say a month or more, and wait for the right moment to sell with the sats sitting in my exchange wallet?

3. I assume it doesn't work in the way that once a price is achieved and my sell order goes through, that I get a request to transfer the actual bitcoin from my paper wallet to some exchange address generated for that transaction?

4. If I want to just do a couple transactions to transfer bitcoin to the exchange, and perhaps buy in again at a later date, what's the safest way of doing it? I have access to:

\- a modern Mac (have used Electrum so far to originally transfer sats to my paper wallet)

\- couple Windows PCs where I can boot linux off of a USB stick (that's how I generated the paper wallet some time ago)

I've recently been acquiring BTC and it's currently sitting on an exchange. It's getting to an amount where I'm ready to move it into cold storage. I've been doing a lot of research here, web, YouTube, etc. Learned a lot from Matthew Kratter's Bitcoin Univeristy channel. I've been debating the best cold wallet and seed storage strategy for myself. I looked into Trezor, Bitbox, Jade, Coldcard, etc.

I was almost ready to pull the trigger on Jade since Kratter endorses them and it's a BTC-only company. However, I think I've changed my mind.

After a lot of reading, I think Trezor's SLIP39 encryption that uses Shamir's Secret Share would be the best wallet for me for securing my backup seeds.

1. I would utilize a 2 of 3 system, storing 1 share in my home safe with the Trezor, 1 share in a relative's safe, and 1 share at my attorney's office.
2. I don't feel safe leaving the full recovery seed at any one of these places, and it's becoming increasingly hard to find safe deposit boxes at banks as they exit that business.
3. SLIP39 with a 2 of 3 seems safer than BIP39 with a passphrase in the event I die unexpectedly and my family needs to recover the wallet.
4. I know there have been some issues with Trezor (the Wasabi thing), as well as supporting alt-coins, but the BTC-only hardware seems secure.
5. If Trezor does do something to lose the trust of the community, Sparrow already supports SLIP39 so I could recover the wallet there and transfer it to do a new cold storage device.

1546,1i11qec,BTC multisig setup,"Hi everyone,

I want to start using  multisig setups but I have some questions that I want to clear before proceeding.

Persons involved:

4 persons total: 1 father + 3 siblings, i am one of the siblings

Devices being currently used:

Each of the persons has a ledger hardware wallet (father and two siblings with nano x, one with nano s) with their own cryptos (mostly bitcoin). and the intention is to use this for long term storage and increase security.

First question: can a multisig wallet be created reusing these seeds? meaning can we create a multisig wallet that will require 3/4 seeds to be assessed and have individual wallets on each of those seeds? the intention would be for each of use to use the existing devices and seeds to create a multisig wallet but have the same device and seed to continue store our individual funds.

First set up (father funds): 4/3 multisig

As my father is not versed with technology, let alone Bitcoin, I am the one managing the funds in his wallet for him (monthly buys for DCA and moving the coins out of the exchange to the hardware wallet).

There are two copies of the seed, one at his house and one at mine, but there are issues with the current situation in terms of security. If one of the copies of the seed gets found by a malicious actor, it is bye bye funds. On top of that I can be accused by my siblings of being the one that stole the funds. Also, assuming my father passes in the future, I can steal the funds from my siblings in case I go rogue.

The goals with the multisig set up are:

Ensure that in case our father passes, the three siblings can get access to the funds together (meaning they need to be aligned on how to split the funds).

Increase security by not having the copies of the seeds in each other's houses or at least not having all seeds in the same place to minimize chances of someone stealing the funds by going into one house.

In case the father needs to get some money (unlikely) out of it he will need the agreement of at least two siblings but I think that can be done in a fairly easy way as we have good relationships.

Second set up (my funds) 3/2 multisig

I also have the seed for one of my siblings' funds at my house while he has a copy of mine. This suffers from the same issues as the set up I have with my father. My idea to circumvent this would be to set another multisig wallet, this time around 3/2 where I would have my sibling, and my father's wallet in order to get them out of the wallet. This way we eliminate the risk of having the funds stolen by someone finding one seed in one house alone.

One last question, to minimize issues on hardware wallet manufacturers' bad actors (firmware exploits on the ledger recovery feature), would it make sense to use this chance to buy new hardware wallets from different manufacturers (for example blockstream jade and coldcard) to have a third layer of security?

If you got this far, thanks for the time spent, if you can point out other issues on the multisig set up i am planning and out to work around them with other setups i would be very thankful.

Am I okay to use an 'older' generated one and it'll still send to my Trezor or do I have to keep generating new addresses?

1557,1i1xf8r,Pocket or Broker: what's the cheaper way to buy Bitcoin?,"I currently buy BTC daily for 10 USD via my broker. With my BitBox02, I could also execute daily BTC purchases via Pocket and have the BTC sent directly to my BitBox. 

With my broker, I first have to convert CHF to USD for a fee of 0.95% per transaction. And then I pay another 1% fee for each purchase of Bitcoin. This currently adds up to about 5.55 CHF per month.

On Pocket, I would pay a 1.5% feee for each purchase of Bitcoin, which would amount to about 4.05 CHF each month when buying BTC daily for 10 CHF. However, the UTXO management implications with Pocket for long-term use are not considered in this calculation (with Pocket, the transactions are made directly on the Blockchain unlike with my broker where the transactions take place on a centralized exchange and all transactions are recorded in the internal ledger and not on the blockchain). 

Assuming an average fee rate (10 satoshis/byte) and a Bitcoin price of $96,000, consolidating 360 UTXOs could cost approximately $235.10 in transaction fees per year. While with one monthly purchase of 300 CHF, the consolidation fee per year would be at only 7.94 USD. Or with 4 monthly purchases of 75 CHF each, the consolidation fee would be 31.43 USD. However, I do want to buy daily to flatten out price volatility.

I am looking for the cheapest and most low-effort way for managing my recurring purchases. Considering the cost of accumulating UTXO via daily buys, I think it might be easiest to continue buying daily via my broker and transferring to my hardware wallet every 10-12 months. Or I switch to Pocket and buy weekly or even monthly, with the downside of not reducing price volatility as much as I would with daily buys.

Ironically now once again don't wanna buy because the price is too high and I'm pretty sure this is the worst time to enter.

I read about time in the market beats timing the market, but I still believe that choosing a sensible entry point is crucial (for example don't buy the all time high).

I can all-in now and regret if we go back to 88k in a week.

I can wait for the potential drop and then regret not buying now if the drop never happens but instead comes a rise (as is the situation now)

I can buy for 10% of the sum now, and next week, and 2 weeks from now, but then the rest of the money just sits around even longer than it already did and there is still good potential that this approach will lead to buying before a larger drop.

1597,1i598oh,"In the future, will Bitcoin hold the title of reserve asset, transactional currency, or both?","I was thinking in the last couple of days of the usage of Bitcoin in the future (5, 10, 15, 20 or more years), and if it was going to be used as a reserve asset, like it's being used at the moment, or if the usability as a transactional currency, as planned in the OG days, can come to fruition, seeing how the US Dollar (and other centralized currencies with absolutley no assets that back them) is being managed.

Now, I know that for having a currency being used, it needs acceptance for the markets, with easy to use transaction systems that are fast and cheap, like the Lighting network, and it needs for a big amount of merchants to adopt them, but I do belive that with more popularity and less hour-by-hour volatility, this can be reached, and Bitcoin will be both a reserve asset for long-term HODLing and a currency for pretty much any type of transactions (also thanks to the boom of crypto-backed loans, as there are always more competitors on the loaning markets, with will offer longer terms, higher LTV and lower interest rates, and in the future could even compete with standard loans).

I would say that this Reddit post is relevant to Bitcoin news. The topic of whether Bitcoin can become a reserve asset or transactional currency is a key discussion point in the cryptocurrency community, and the author's thoughts on the potential for Bitcoin to achieve both are valid and timely.

The mention of specific technologies like the Lightning Network and the development of crypto-backed loans also adds relevance to the post. Additionally, the author's consideration of the current state of fiat currencies (such as the US Dollar) and their management is a common theme in discussions about the future of cryptocurrencies.

Overall, I would classify this post as relevant to Bitcoin news and opinion."
1598,1i5apcd,How to say small BTC values in words?,"Hi,

I'm new to BTC and I'm not sure how to say in words very small numbers of BTC.

I don't know whether to say Millibits, Bits or Satoshis.

Say I took 

1 BTC = $85,424.39

and if I divide $85,424.39 by 10,000,000, the result is 0.00854244  
This is 8 digits after the decimal point. And the first two digits are zeros.

I don't know what words to use to describe this.

Would I have, 8.54 millibits? Or would I have 854,244 Satoshis?

This might be very obvious to some people, but it is confusing me!

Thanks

Say you have 3 miners with 2T each, is it seen as a 6T contribution by the pool or as 3 different 2T contribution? 

3) How does the pool know the 3 machines are yours if you don’t need a registration ?

4) I understand you can operate them as lottery miners and get nothing daily, or as pool miners and get a few sats daily… how do you choose/configure those 2 options?

I’m planning on buying a bunch of miners soon. I’m well versed in mining and can easily set up the 3 phase power so that isn’t a problem, and I have a good electricity price. The t21 seems to be much cheaper and have a very good price per TH.

1672,1i9voqu,DCA now or await the bull end-of-cycle potential downturn?,"Seeing a lot of threads about DCAing until 2030 etc. 

Let me preface this by saying that long term I obviously think BTC valuation goes up as more people/institutions/countries are onboarded considering BTC’s unique characteristics and momentum. That’s the easy part. 

But, considering the cycles that played out in 2017 and 2021, do you think that it is wise to start DCAing in now at ATHs or await a (somewhat expected) downturn prior to starting such. 

Not cynical, I’m curious. Obviously history doesn’t always repeat, and I’m sure someone will argue that previous results don’t necessarily indicate that there will be a downturn at all, and I agree that institutional holdings obviously increase BTC’s price floor in general, but would you say that you are that confident that this time will be different? 

Or is it more so that whole point of DCAing is not having to worry about these things — that sure, early on it might not have the greatest returns starting now, but on a 5+ years time horizon, it’s more so a blimp rather than an risk to start now? 

I guess I can also see the counter argument — in that we don’t know what will happen, and to assume a short term downturn is as much speculation as any.

So I'd love to run a bitcoin node to help the community, but if it could also be a source of passive income, I'd love to kill two birds here.
