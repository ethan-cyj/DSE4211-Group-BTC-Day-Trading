If BTCUSDT breaks above the $102,800 resistance with significant volume, it could trigger a bullish breakout. A failure to break above the resistance could lead to a pullback toward the support trendline. If the price breaks and closes above $102,800, consider a long position with targets at $103,500 - $104,000 - $105,000. Keep eye on it .

Bitcoin is retesting a key support level, and holding this zone could drive a move toward resistance, potentially leading to a new all-time high. However, a breakdown may result in further declines. Recently, BTC has traded in a narrow range with lower volume, showing reduced market activity. It is currently consolidating, and the next move depends on key support and resistance levels. A breakout above resistance could push BTC higher, while failing to hold support may lead to a deeper pullback.  - Binance Killers",0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,2025,12,5,neutral,2.0114699074074074,0.2659013237248541
