A symmetrical triangle is typically a neutral pattern, meaning the direction of the breakout, whether bullish or bearish, depends on prevailing market forces. If BTC breaks above the upper trendline with significant volume, it could signal a continuation of the prevailing uptrend, potentially targeting new resistance levels. Conversely, a breakdown below the lower trendline may trigger a sell-off, leading to key support retests.  - Binance Killers",2025-02-24,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,neutral,0,2025,9,0
