Source: This is on-chain data. Meaning insights that you can attain from the data stored on the blockchain. For this, I used Dune, but can be found using apps like etherscan or hosting a block, etc.

day is the day 
daily_active_addresses is the number of wallet addresses that either buy or sold bitcoin
buy_ins is the number of wallet addresses that bought bitcoin
sells is the number of wallet addresses that sold bitcoin

Just in case anyone wondering, buy_ins + sells != daily_active_addresses because a transaction sometimes consists of one person sell, one person buy.

Whales are people like a LOT of bitcoin
Whale transaction is usually 1000+ transacted bitcoins. Here, I just used transaction of 100 bitcoins, so i called it miniwhale! 100 btc is still $8,500,000

total_in_value_btc and total_out_value_btc differs by a little due to transaction fees

Source: GDELTSv2 which is a relational database of all news to ever exist pulled from bigquery. I filtered for 
      LOWER(Themes) LIKE '%blockchain%'
      OR LOWER(Themes) LIKE '%bitcoin%'
