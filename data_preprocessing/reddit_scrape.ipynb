The network adjusts the difficulty approximately every two weeks to ensure that a block is mined roughly every 10 minutes.\\n### Calculations\\n1. **Network Hash Rate**: The total hash rate of the Bitcoin network can influence how long it takes to mine new coins. For this example, let's assume the current network hash rate is around 300 EH/s (300,000,000 GH/s), which is a rough estimate.\\n2. **Probability of Finding a Block**: The probability of your mining operation (200 GH/s) finding a block can be calculated as follows:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\text{Probability} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Your Hash Rate}}{\\\\text{Network Hash Rate}} = \\\\frac{200 \\\\text{ GH/s}}{300,000,000 \\\\text{ GH/s}} \\\\approx 0.0000006667\\n   \\\\]\\n3. **Expected Number of Blocks**: Knowing that it takes about 10 minutes to find a block on average, the expected time to find one block is:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\text{Expected Time to Find One Block (in minutes)} = \\\\frac{10 \\\\text{ minutes}}{0.0000006667} \\\\approx 15,000,000 \\\\text{ minutes} \\\\approx 28.5 \\\\text{ years}\\n   \\\\]\\n4. **Mining 0.02 Bitcoin**: Since the block reward is 6.25 bitcoins per block, you would need to mine a portion of a block to get 0.02 bitcoins:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\text{Expected Time to Mine 0.02 Bitcoin} \\\\approx \\\\frac{0.02 \\\\text{ Bitcoin}}{6.25 \\\\text{ Bitcoin/block}} \\\\times 15,000,000 \\\\text{ minutes} \\\\approx 48,000 \\\\text{ minutes} \\\\approx 33.3 \\\\text{ days}\\n   \\\\]\\n### Summary\\nAt a hash rate of 200 GH/s, it is estimated that you would take approximately **33.3 days** to mine **0.02 bitcoins**, assuming constant network difficulty and no changes in the hash rate.

Typically SWIFT just delivers the information from banks for example, while the banks handle the actual settlement.\\n\\n.\\n.\\n\\nChainlinks CCIP has been purposely built to directly connect to the SWIFT\\'s existing systems as demonstrated here in 2023; \\nEVIDENCE:\\nhttps://www.swift.com/news-events/news/swift-explores-blockchain-interoperability-remove-friction-tokenised-asset-settlement\\n\\n>“There’s unlikely to be a single prevailing blockchain network,” said Tom Zschach, Chief Innovation Officer at Swift. “We would expect to see a multitude of different platforms emerging, each serving different customer segments with their own bespoke capabilities and requirements. In such a highly fragmented ecosystem, it would simply not be feasible for financial institutions to connect to each and every platform individually. That’s why the community is working with Swift to develop an interoperability model that would enable access to different platforms globally.” \\n\\n>Instead of building new infrastructure and technology stacks entirely from scratch, financial institutions want to leverage their existing infrastructure to connect to blockchain ledgers, where tokens are recorded in a way that is both compliant and secure. Not only would this help firms simplify their architecture and operations, but it also minimises investment costs and reduces risk of technology obsolescence.\\n\\n\\nIn the same year (2023), using CCIP enhanced SWIFT system, ANZ (Largest bank in AUS, 1trillion assests under management) successfully demonstrated how ANZ customers could use CCIP to securely transfer ANZ-issued stablecoins cross-chain to purchase nature-based assets. This happened in one transaction across 2 chains. One public chain (AVA) and a permissioned private chain. \\n\\nAnurag Soin, director of digital asset services at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd explains it all here (5mins long, definitely worth watching); \\nEVIDENCE: \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4D6drgwS0\\n\\nhttps://chain.link/resources/cross-chain-tokenized-asset-settlement\\n\\n\\nThis brings us to more recent developments with SWIFT in 2024; \\nhttps://www.swift.com/news-events/press-releases/swift-ubs-asset-management-and-chainlink-successfully-complete-innovative-pilot-bridge-tokenized-assets-existing-payment-systems\\n\\nMore of what we already know, but done at scale across multiple different banks, all utilising existing SWIFT infrastructure with CCIP to settle subscriptions and settlements of tokenised funds. \\n\\n>Chainlink platform and the Swift network to settle subscriptions and redemptions for tokenized investment fund vehicles, thereby allowing the straight-through-processing of the payment leg without the need for the global adoption of an on-chain form of payment. This helps in the automation of the entire lifecycle of the fund redemption and subscription process.\\n\\n>“For digital assets to be adopted globally, they must seamlessly integrate with both existing payment systems and digital currencies,\" said Jonathan Ehrenfeld, Head of Strategy, Swift. \\n\\n\\nI have established that Chainlink and SWIFT have been working and building together for 8 years. \\n\\nTheir aim was to build upon the existing SWIFT network, improving it with Chainlink\\'s CCIP, to allow banks to access blockchains/DLT services. \\n\\nThey have succeeded. Chainlink\\'s CCIP is a Swift designed product. \\n\\nWhat does this mean for blockchains/DLT? \\n\\nBanks do not need to change existing systems or work methods. They just use CCIP. \\n\\nBanks do not to integrate individually with each blockchain. They just use CCIP. \\n\\nBanks do not need to hold 100\\'s of different blockchain gas tokens. They just use CCIP. \\n\\nSWIFT won\\'t connect to any blockchains. SWIFT will connect to Chainlink. \\n\\nChainlink will connect to everything. \\n\\n\\n\\n*Please only respond in good faith, posting evidence of your opinion.

Price Action & Market Structure\\n\\n* **Trendlines & Breakouts:**\\n   * I frequently track **descending & ascending trendlines** to identify breakout points.\\n   * I **wait for confirmation (candlestick closes) before calling a breakout valid**.\\n   * Retests of key levels **(previous resistance turning into support)** are crucial in my analysis.\\n* **Support & Resistance:**\\n   * I **identify major historical support/resistance zones** and assess **whether price respects them**.\\n   * I look for **wick rejections & consolidation** before determining strength at key levels.\\n* **Candlestick Patterns & Structure:**\\n   * I often **identify reversal patterns (e.g., doji, hammer, engulfing candles)**.\\n   * I pay attention to **volume spikes** at key levels to validate price reactions.\\n\\n# 🔹 2. Moving Averages & Trend Indicators\\n\\n* **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA 50, 100, 200):**\\n   * I use **EMA crossovers for trend shifts** (e.g., EMA 50 crossing below EMA 200 as a bearish sign).\\n   * **EMA support & resistance:** I check how price interacts with moving averages for additional confluence.\\n* **Momentum Indicators:**\\n   * **RSI (14)**\\n      * I check **RSI divergence** to detect possible reversals before they happen.\\n      * RSI above 70 = potential overbought | RSI below 30 = potential oversold.\\n   * **Squeeze Momentum Indicator:**\\n      * I analyze **green/red histogram shifts** to spot potential trend reversals.\\n      * I wait for a **momentum shift confirmation before entering trades**.\\n\\n# 🔹 3.

This move marks a significant step in Japan's regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, aligning with its progressive stance on digital assets.\\n\\nRegulatory Framework:\\nJapan has been at the forefront of crypto regulation, having established a robust framework that includes the Payment Services Act (PSA) and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA). The PSA currently covers cryptocurrency custody services, while the FIEA regulates cryptocurrency derivatives companies. By revising the FIEA to include crypto assets as financial products, Japan aims to enhance regulatory clarity and investor protection.\\n\\nInsider Trading Restrictions:\\nAs part of this initiative, crypto assets will be subject to insider trading restrictions, prohibiting transactions based on undisclosed internal information. This measure aligns with traditional financial markets' regulations, ensuring fairness and transparency in crypto trading.\\n\\nLegislative Proposal:\\nThe FSA is expected to submit a bill to parliament as early as 2026 to amend the FIEA, formalizing crypto assets' status as financial products. This legislative move could pave the way for further financial innovations, such as crypto ETFs, which have been sought by industry stakeholders.\\n\\nImpact on Adoption and Innovation:\\nJapan's decision could boost crypto adoption by providing a clearer legal framework, potentially attracting more institutional investors. It also aligns with Japan's broader strategy to promote technology-based sectors, including blockchain and Web3 technologies. However, past incidents like the Mt. Gox and Coincheck hacks have led to cautious regulatory approaches, balancing innovation with investor protection.\\n\\nGlobal Implications:\\nJapan's move may influence other countries' regulatory approaches to crypto assets. As a leader in crypto regulation, Japan's framework could serve as a model for jurisdictions seeking to balance innovation with regulatory oversight.\\n\\n\\nJapan's plan to give crypto assets legal status as financial products reflects its commitment to creating a robust and regulated crypto market. This move is expected to enhance transparency, protect investors, and potentially stimulate further innovation in the sector.

So far, it’s worked shockingly well. No complex indicators, no deep analysis.  \\n\\nJust pure, unfiltered idiotic, dumbness.  \\n\\n### Here’s how it works:  \\n\\n1. **Portfolio Tracking:** I log all my holdings in a portfolio tracker.  \\n\\n2. **Time-Warped Buys:** Whenever I purchase a crypto, I retroactively mark my buy as if I had entered on the very first day of its existence. Example: If I buy today, but the token launched on Jan 1, 2020, I log it as if I bought it on launch day. Why? To create a historical \"ups and downs\" chart that isn\\'t biased by my real entry.  \\n\\n3. **The Half-Mountain Rule:** I examine the chart and ask myself one question: Has a **half-mountain** formed relative to past peaks? (Half mountain is the past ATH of my portfolio which now serves as my sell point. **Not** the ATH of the market. And **not** the ATH of one crypto but my whole diversified portfolio over many years. When an ATH hits again, I sell and wait for the other side to form). \\n\\n   - **Yes?** I sell everything. Data: [Example 1](https://i.imgur.com/YfiQ0lT.png), [Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/BNwwknP.png).  \\n   - **No?** I keep accumulating. Data: [Currently buying](https://i.imgur.com/hsaaQ6Q.png).  \\n\\n4 . **Bottom Fishing:** Once a solid bottom forms, I go all in again.  \\n\\nThat’s it. No trendlines, no RSI, no Fibonacci which makes me cringe as hell. Just mountains and valleys.  \\n\\nThis approach has kept me from FOMO-buying tops while letting me accumulate when assets are genuinely undervalued. Obviously, this isn’t financial advice, and I fully expect it to blow up in my face at some point but for now, it’s working. Don’t believe me? Check my post history.  \\n\\nAt this moment, I’m aggressively buying and waiting for the next half-mountain to form, ideally mirroring prior peaks.  \\n\\n### Important Notes:  \\n- I track **10+ cryptos simultaneously** this method is useless if applied to just one.  \\n- This does **not** work for BTC. Bitcoin doesn’t form mountains; it just keeps climbing.  \\n- Again, **this does not apply to BTC.**', 'author': 'SquatDeadliftBench', 'upvotes': 95, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 95, 'num_comments': 85, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jlkdfy/how_i_time_the_market_in_the_dumbest_yet_simplest/', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-28 02:07:19+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-04-02 22:12:02+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jq1gbt', 'title': 'Algorand currently has $410 million worth of stocks tokenized on its rails.

In this edition of Polymarket scam accusations, we are looking at a new question, but what if UMA actually goes rogue?\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ed6ufcm3q2re1.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=c305364b628e2e08464cf0c200957413c0224e81\\n\\nWhat you need to know about Polymarket - It\\'s a prediction betting market most popularly on Polygon, where users wager on real world events with USDC. The real world can be complicated and not always fit into the black and white confines of the \"established rules\" on the markets, as such this creates a lot of space for scam accusations to develop.\\n\\n\\\\---\\n\\nAs this post is mostly about UMA, lets dive in. UMA is the \"Decentralized\" Oracle for Polymarket one of their most important utilities is deciding the outcome of contested markets on Polymarket. Here\\'s how it works:\\n\\nA Polymarket user puts up money to propose an outcome -> other polymarket users can dispute it by putting up money -> if disputed users can again put up money to propose an outcome -> other polymarket users can again dispute it by putting up money -> If it gets disputed 2x it goes to UMA to resolve before a Final Outcome of the market on Polymarket can happen.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2sh9o4tbi2re1.png?width=310&format=png&auto=webp&s=01109fa15719261d5383e6434efa0b00c3e67bae\\n\\nUMA token holders can stake their tokens and then vote on the controversial markets with the weight of their vote equal to the amount of tokens they have staked. Now the thing about UMA is that similar to most web3 governance protocols it\\'s a full blown Plutocracy. In this case only two unique UMA token holders are needed to reach an agreement and resolve any polymarket clarification how they see fit..\\n\\n*If you want to read a slightly deeper look into UMA - I\\'ve written about it on a previous post* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1g06kgs/polymarket_bettors_are_heading_to_trustpilot_to/)*.*\\n\\nObviously there are some glaring red flags with this model: Two UMA whale token holders independently control the outcomes of markets and can trade and profit on the outcomes that they determine. This creates an incentive to resolve controversial markets in a way that might not exactly match reality to increase the profit on those markets.\\n\\nThis has long been countered by Polymarket making \"clarifications\" on extremely controversial markets - where they tell UMA how to vote, and UMA (previously) has always fallen in line with a clarification. Largely because if Polymarket abandoned UMA it would be death knell to the UMA token, so going against Polymarket is a bad idea for these whale token holders.\\n\\nExample of a clarification:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1mn8u28gk2re1.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=44d46d730179fb95a141d6f943424657bb14740f\\n\\nNow that we know the details let jump into the actual market and scam that just happened.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ibpnpikk2re1.png?width=1026&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c4e80aaf09c1603174493c243cfc9494f7a4aea\\n\\nThe market was \"Ukraine agrees to Trump mineral deal before April?\" In the middle of March this market was proposed yes and disputed, two separate times so it went to UMA to vote.\\n\\nPolymarket issued a clarification saying no deal was made and that this market should resolve no, against the proposed resolution.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5y8olbjuk2re1.png?width=1011&format=png&auto=webp&s=260187178c6d54ac6556b83520115e124e7edf5a\\n\\nNow what always happens in a market like this is UMA votes no, just like Polymarket tells them to do. However in this instance one of the two whales along with other UMA token holders decided to go rogue against reality and Polymarket and resolve this market contrary to yes.\\n\\n[https:\\\\/\\\\/vote.uma.xyz\\\\/past-votes](https://preview.redd.it/xnhtihcwl2re1.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=8159a1ae0f6393200e2c2d2b8c9887aead0b79f6)\\n\\nAs a result Polymarket has stated they will honor the UMA vote as is their dispute process and resolve their market, yes.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jagrrg57m2re1.png?width=983&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a0e884e9ecd365f9e94d774e7c55f2d4304dc4f\\n\\nNow you might be thinking, wait what isn\\'t this a scam? UMA voted for a resolution that didn\\'t match reality because one of the two whales that controls the outcome went rogue? Now Polymarket is scamming the bettors who placed money on a resolution that didn\\'t match the actual reality? The answer is yes.\\n\\nThe market in question had over $7M in volume and everyone who bet on the actual reality of the market lost money.\\n\\nIn a rare case Polymarket has even acknowledged that the market resolution was unfair but they stated they\\'re not able to pay out $7M in refunds and as such everyone who lost money is out of luck.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1g19hwz3n2re1.png?width=1412&format=png&auto=webp&s=427eb60cba6d1a71bc60b5de497bc883c4d5d85c\\n\\nSo... What now?

When was the last time ripple has some something for US? The investors, the consumers? As far as I know, Trump saving us from the SEC and financial firms finally trusting it enough to make ETFs is the only good news. Why isn’t ripple making their use case real themselves? Whats stopping them?\\n\\n===============\\n\\nThis ends the post. Really pissed me off that I got removed for asking this. Was a huge XRP fan, turning into a maxi more and more every day. \\n\\n\\n\\n', 'author': 'zC0NN0Rz', 'upvotes': 56, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 56, 'num_comments': 117, 'url':

The campaign initially promised that the top two projects with the highest votes would proceed to Binance’s due diligence process for potential listing. However, in a surprising twist, Binance ultimately listed four projects. So how is this a scandal ? \\n\\nWell for starters. There is a PVP going on BNB chain between three projects, all named Broccoli. Two of which were on the vote to list batch but the one with the largest community was not and was reserved for the next round of voting. One of the Broccolies came 5th with only 7000 eligble votes and the other came last at the 9th position. But Binance went ahead and listed the one 5th position along with three other projects. Reking all the people who fomoed into the community broccoli because they thought both of the other two lost. Please note that no where in their Terms and condition they mention they are able to alter the number of winners. \\n\\nThe broccoli that got listed is pushed by Chinese KOLs who enjoy a close relationship with BNB staff. Just hours before annoucement , They exited all their positions on the community one which means they had insider info or a backdoor deal. \\n\\nThe funny thing is , two of the projects that got listed are pushed by the same cabal. And one of them is down by more than %15 after annoucement. \\n\\n\\n', 'author': 'Dashaaaa', 'upvotes': 33, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 33, 'num_comments': 41, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jlqg62/binances_vote_to_list_scandal/', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-28 08:35:36+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-03-28 13:17:30+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jluusw', 'title': \"The PDai situation with the pulsechain community is probably the funniest thing I've seen in awhile.\", 'body': '\\n Pdai is forked dai token with no peg on pulsechian.

Additionally you do not have immediate access to your coins. First you need to KYC and get approval from the Pi Network team. What an innovative thing!

It\\'s so cool!  \\n  \\nSo how do you get one? First is you need to set up your Reddit vault. To do this, you need to launch the Reddit app in your mobile phone then click your profile pic in the top right corner of your screen. Then choose \"Style Avatar\" button. After that, select the \"You\" tab. Then click \"Your stuff\". And then press the Vault icon to begin Vault setup and follow the instructions to create your very own Reddit vault. For security purposes, you need to write down on a piece of paper your Recovery Phrase and keep it safe in case you need to recover your Reddit vault.\\n\\nOnce you have already your Reddit vault, you can now go shopping for Reddit avatars. To do this, just click your profile pic in Reddit then click \"Style Avatar\" and then click \"Shop\". Then scroll down to the Creators section and click \"All Creators.\" You will then see a list of artists, which is in alphabetical order. Scroll down and click the name of showwwy87. You will then see all the avatars that the artist has released. Find and buy his totem and bird seed avatars. \\n\\nOnce you have bought these avatars, you can click Edit or Style Avatar to do some mashups. To form the Bitcoin logo, you must click the bird seed avatar and click the avatar\\'s right hand trait (the one that appears on the upper left most side). Next, you must click \"x\" or close. Then click the totem avatar and click the avatar\\'s left hand trait and head. Then click \"x\" or close. Then click \"Save\".  And voila, you have formed a mashup and uploaded it as your avatar or profile pic in Reddit!\\n\\nIf you want to hide the eyes, body and legs of the avatar so that only the Bitcoin logo can be seen, you need to buy the Display Box avatar by the artist Bogi\\\\_di. If you have a Display Box already, all you need to do is click on the Display Box\\'s eyes, body and legs in order to make them invisible.

There was over $7M in volume on this market.  The market’s resolution specifically stated only official statements from the U.S. and Ukrainian governments would count as evidence.   \\n  \\nOn March 25, 2025, a user submitted a “Yes” proposal, claiming the deal had been agreed upon. This was disputed, kicking off UMA’s two-day voting process: a one-day commit period (where voters lock in their choices) followed by a one-day reveal period (where votes are finalized). If a consensus threshold is reached, the market resolves accordingly. This is where things got messy.  \\n  \\nAfter every voter had already committed their votes, Polymarket stated at 11:58 PM UTC on Sunday, March 23 (just two minutes before the commit period ended) it was “too early” for the market to resolve and that, based on available evidence (or lack thereof), it wasn’t a “Yes” yet. No official statements from the U.S. or Ukraine confirmed a deal; Trump’s vague claim of a “soon-to-be-signed” agreement and Zelenskyy’s musings about a “bigger deal” didn’t meet the criteria. Traders betting “No” breathed a sigh of relief, assuming Polymarket would enforce its own rules.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9bgsyqsld3re1.jpg?width=1076&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a32f5a3f24a6783a8817179c23d62f1e16cfceff\\n\\nHowever, one UMA whale cast \\\\~25% of the vote  in favor of \"Yes,\" ignoring Polymarket’s clarification entirely.  Now, UMA slashes rewards for an incorrect vote (aka doesn\\'t align with majority). The big wallets  doubled down on “Yes” to secure their rewards and avoid losses. By Monday, March 24, at 11:58 PM UTC—two minutes before the reveal period closed—Polymarket issued another clarification, this time conceding that the market would resolve per UMA’s vote: “Yes.”   \\n  \\nThe result - \"yes\" won despite not being \"yes\" per market rules.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7btphhtrd3re1.jpg?width=1632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0c7f0f398e55565f9c8b22b9677c896bbcef4e9\\n\\nIn addition to the whale vote, many UMA voters are a core group of token holders, many affiliated with or part of the UMA team itself.  Their decision to push “Yes” wasn’t a grand conspiracy; it was a lazy, reward-driven choice to disregard Polymarket’s last-second guidance. They faced a binary gamble - a prisoner\\'s dilemma - to vote with the pack or risk being slashed.  They chose the path of least resistance.  \\n  \\nWhile UMA’s whales bear some blame for their cavalier voting, Polymarket also deserves criticism. They could have intervened earlier, giving voters clear direction during the commit phase, or even paused the market entirely via an emergency function, but instead they issued a clarification so late it was effectively useless, and then went along with UMA’s vote.  \\n  \\nPolymarket acknowledged the controversy on the platform’s Discord server, admitting the outcome went against user expectations and Polymarket’s own clarifications. However, the team classified it as an unprecedented situation rather than a market failure, stating they could not issue refunds.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2a16ybmod3re1.jpg?width=1624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15976e91d18ca24ad506f6cb289af9c3599886e1\\n\\nFor my own thoughts, I am a deep believer in Polymarket and predictions as a tool.  It\\'s clear there are still problems to solve, exploits to patch, and incentives to be optimized. But it\\'s also clear there are people working on these problems.  Looking long term (10+ years out), this technology will become insanely powerful and ubiquitous, but there will be growing pains along the way.\\n\\n', 'author': '002_timmy', 'upvotes': 10, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 10, 'num_comments': 5, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jkli49/the_polymarket_mineral_deal_controversy_a_tale_of/', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-26 20:16:01+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-03-25 23:52:23+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jjy989', 'title': 'Polymarket piece', 'body': 'No text body (link post)', 'author': 'iamzheone', 'upvotes': 11, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 11, 'num_comments': 5, 'url': '/r/u_iamzheone/comments/1jjk8qe/polymarket_piece/', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-25 23:52:23+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-03-25 08:11:23+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jjees7', 'title': 'Bitcoin in the bush - crypto mining brings power to rural areas', 'body': 'No text body (link post)', 'author': 'daltadka911', 'upvotes': 10, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 10, 'num_comments': 4, 'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly4xe373p4o', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-25 08:11:23+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-04-01 18:06:12+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jp2czj', 'title': 'Mastercard working on Blockchain to connect TradFi and Crypto', 'body': 'No text body (link post)', 'author': 'CriticalCobraz', 'upvotes': 9, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 9, 'num_comments': 7, 'url': 'https://crypto.news/mastercard-working-on-blockchain-to-connect-tradfi-and-crypto-report/', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-04-01 18:06:12+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-04-01 15:30:56+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1joyh5b', 'title': 'Oracles will capture $200B+ in revenue as real world businesses and AI bridge to blockchains', 'body': 'No text body (link post)', 'author': 'renkure', 'upvotes': 8, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 8, 'num_comments': 5, 'url': 'https://peakd.com/@badbitch/oracles-will-capture-200b-in-revenue-as-real-world-businesses-and-ai-bridge-to-blockchains-42l', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-04-01 15:30:56+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-03-31 05:36:04+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jnw6h0', 'title': 'Binance debuts centralized exchange to decentralized exchange trades', 'body': 'In such a case, is DEX a DEX?

Please correct me if I am wrong but its my understanding that at the exchange level (Coinbase, Crypto(.)com etc.) your seed phrase and private keys are held by the exchange and therefore you do not own the crypto you purchased.  It's all my understanding that with a hot wallet (Exodus, Trust etc.) you have access to your seed phrase and private keys so you have complete access to your purchased crypto.  My question is with cold wallets (Ledge, Trezor, etc.) and how are they different than a hot wallet.  If you can use your seed phrase to gain access to your digital wallet from your cold wallet device doesn't that hashed seed phrase need to be stored online?  A friend of mine involved with this conversation asked if all you need is the seed phrase to gain access to a wallet then a cold wallet is no more secure than a hot wallet. Another question I have is do cold wallets store your crypto coins on them, if so how does that get back to the block chain to record the movement of said crypto.  Thanks all sorry for the newbie questions I am about to deep dive this so I can be clear when I tell them why a cold wallet is more secure than a hot wallet.  \", 'author': 'socal01', 'upvotes': 7, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 7, 'num_comments': 15, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jlwn4z/seed_phrases/', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-28 14:41:23+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-03-26 17:11:30+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jkgyt8', 'title': \"Binance listing manipulated Jelly token spurs 'FTX-like' takedown rumors for HyperLiquid\", 'body': 'No text body (link post)', 'author': 'Illperformance6969', 'upvotes': 9, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 9, 'num_comments': 10, 'url': 'https://cryptoslate.com/binance-listing-manipulated-jelly-token-spurs-ftx-like-takedown-rumors-for-hyperliquid/', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-26 17:11:30+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-04-01 16:04:31+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jozbk0', 'title': 'Tether bought 8,888 bitcoin in Q1, bringing its total holdings to $7.8 billion — the sixth largest in a single wallet', 'body': 'No text body (link post)', 'author': 'hiorea', 'upvotes': 10, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 10, 'num_comments': 3, 'url': 'https://www.theblock.co/post/348983/tether-bitcoin-purchase-q1-2025?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-04-01 16:04:31+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-03-28 14:49:43+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jlwtvz', 'title': 'Crypto Bill to Combat Illicit Activity Gets New Push After Passing U.S. House in 2024', 'body': 'No text body (link post)', 'author': 'goldyluckinblokchain', 'upvotes': 7, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 7, 'num_comments': 2, 'url': 'https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/03/28/crypto-bill-to-combat-illicit-activity-gets-new-push-after-passing-u-s-house-in-2024', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-28 14:49:43+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-04-02 22:06:16+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jq1b9v', 'title': 'Ethereum Flips Solana in DEX Trading Volume for the First Time in 6 Months', 'body': 'No text body (link post)', 'author': 'CriticalCobraz', 'upvotes': 27, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 27, 'num_comments': 5, 'url': 'https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-dex-volume-leads-over-solana/', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-04-02 22:06:16+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-04-02 16:37:17+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jpt3vy', 'title': 'Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs Could See $3B in Q2 Inflows Even Without Price Recovery, Says Analyst', 'body': 'No text body (link post)', 'author': 'Every_Hunt_160', 'upvotes': 8, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 8, 'num_comments': 5, 'url': 'https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/04/02/bitcoin-etfs-could-see-usd3b-in-q2-inflows-even-without-price-recovery-says-analyst', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-04-02 16:37:17+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-03-31 20:53:44+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jodv8j', 'title': 'CFTC Withdraws Advisory on Crypto Derivatives, Removing Regulatory Hurdle for Listings', 'body': 'No text body (link post)', 'author': 'partymsl', 'upvotes': 6, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 6, 'num_comments': 3, 'url': 'https://dailyhodl.com/2025/03/31/cftc-withdraws-advisory-on-crypto-derivatives-removing-regulatory-hurdle-for-listings/', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-31 20:53:44+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-03-31 19:53:40+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1joce5t', 'title': 'UK - sell crypto before tax year and after new tax year', 'body': \"Hi\\n\\nI'm based in United Kingdom, I want to sell a portion of my crypto that I have.

His design ideas culminated in that the payment should finalize from the seller and towards the buyer (with \"staggered timeouts\"), enforced with a penalty for intermediaries who did not propagate the finalize signal. The penalty was the full payment (and as this was not acceptable, Ryan started to work on ideas for global commit registers instead).  \\n  \\nRather than using the full payment as penalty, as Ryan did, the size of the penalty can be reduced. Instead of letting the payment time out instantly, it can simply gradually reduce how much can be finalized, thus slowly penalizing an intermediary who does not propagate \"finalize\". This is conceptually trivial, but implementation is not entirely trivial. To use a reduced penalty, you first need to set up an agreement for the whole payment chain to start imposing such a penalty. To solve this, you need to rely on the fact that a \"buyer cancels\" signal can be enforced by a penalty as well.  \\n  \\nGame theoretically, anyone who is in a net negative balance at a point during the payment can be forced to perform an action by the use of a penalty (I formally define this in\\xa0[my whitepaper](https://ripple.archi/ripple-multi-server.pdf)). This is quite easy to understand, and it is what Ryan Fugger made use of with his \"seller finalizes\" idea. With same penalty then, you can also enforce the agreement from buyer towards seller that everyone sets up the penalty system. This is enforced by that the penalty system acts on the buyer there (as they have the net negative balance) and thus forces them to cancel unless everyone agreed to \"commit\" to the payment (the seller is who signals the buyer when everyone committed...).  \\n  \\nThus \"seller finalizes\" and \"buyer cancels\" together with a penalty is the game theoretical foundation for how you can build a true Ripple Inter Server Protocol. \"Buyer cancels\" is necessary for the payment chain to agree to enforce the penalty, and \"seller finalizes\" is necessary to agree to finish the payment. In between those, you also need a signal to prove the buyer revoked their right to cancel (thus avoiding attack where \"seller finalizes\" and \"buyer cancels\" were issued at same time), this signal can also be enforced by the penalty system as such system was already set up during \"commit\" step.  \\n  \\nA full implementation of these rules can be found on\\xa0[https://bitbucket.org/bipedaljoe/ripple](https://bitbucket.org/bipedaljoe/ripple).  \\n  \\n*(The \"penalty\" itself is the users in the payment chain collecting fees in a process where cheating only impacts the user\\'s own relationships. I.e., users who suffer a \"reserve credit attack\" simply pay themselves for the damage.

This is where\\xa0Web3 domains\\xa0come into play, providing a human-readable way to navigate the decentralized web.\\n\\nA\\xa0Web3 domain\\xa0is a blockchain-based domain name that serves as a human-readable identifier for digital wallets, websites, and decentralized applications. Unlike traditional domains, which rely on centralized registrars,\\xa0Web3 domains are stored onchain, meaning users have full control over them without renewal fees.\\n\\nKey Benefits of Web3 Domains:\\n\\n* True Ownership\\xa0– Once purchased, Web3 domains belong to the user forever, with no renewal costs.\\n* Crypto Payments\\xa0– Domains can replace long wallet addresses, simplifying transactions with over 300 cryptocurrencies.\\n* Web3 Login\\xa0– Use your domain to log in to dApps and Web3 platforms without relying on third parties.\\n* Decentralized Websites\\xa0– Host content on decentralized storage networks like IPFS or Arweave.\\n* Messaging & Identity\\xa0– Domains can be used for encrypted messaging and serve as a unique onchain identity.\\n\\nWeb3 domains are more than just website addresses; they act as a\\xa0versatile digital identity\\xa0in the blockchain space.

The focus is on what the user wants to accomplish rather than how it should be executed, leaving the execution details to be handled by other parties or mechanisms in the system.  \\n  \\nThis is a shift from traditional transaction models, where users explicitly define every detail of a transaction (e.g., \"send X amount of token A to address B\").   \\n  \\nAs a user, if I\\'m swapping USDC for ETH, I care more about getting the most ETH possible than I care about the routes taken to get the ETH.   \\nIf I\\'m bridging from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon PoS, I don\\'t care what bridge is used (typically), I just want to use the bridge that has the lowest fees.  \\n  \\nIntents means the user doesn\\'t need to manually find the best exchange, calculate gas fees, or optimize the route - it just gets them the best possible outcome.   \\n  \\nBut how do they work?  \\n  \\nOnce an intent is declared, its processed by a network of solvers, fillers, or automated protocols that compete or collaborate to fulfill the intent efficiently. This means the end user gets best experience possible as all the complexity of blockchain transactions get abstract to achieve the optimal outcome.  \\n  \\nThe trade-off risk basically boils down to centralization & trust required. Users rely on solvers or third parties to execute intents fairly, so if there are bad actors, the system breaks.  However, since the solutions are open sourced and still onchain, bad solvers get exposed rather quickly. \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t be surprised if reputation protocols start popping up to evaluate solvers and mitigate the bad-actor risk. \\n\\nIntents make life easier. State your goal, and let the solvers work their magic.

The Torum team has ensured that.\\n\\nIt won’t work if you go straight to withdraw from the site. You will have to fill out a Google Form, and the Torum team will get back to you in two weeks.\\n\\nHere is the post by Jason Tay (Torum Team): [https://www.torum.com/u/jayson](https://www.torum.com/u/jayson)\\n\\nThe Google Form is in the post. So, go on and fill in your details, including where you would like your Torum to be deposited. There are only two exchanges – KuCoin and Huobi. Do it before 31st March 2025. After that, all data will be purged (I guess) and all XTM burned permanently.\\n\\nThat’s It.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8135y63y5fre1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=363b7585e93ed9f934f2d8d5180139245eea8a67\\n\\n# Now the Long Story\\n\\nWhile XTM is worthless at the moment, Torum has some plans. Torum has already launched a crypto exchange and is now the sixth licensed crypto exchange (DAX) in Malaysia. They are also in the process of launching Torum Pay, an e-wallet for crypto transactions with VISA integration. In all this, they intend to keep XTM as the native token, and so, a chance that the value would increase in the future. Although, they claim the tokenomics would change.\\n\\nSo, if it works, your XTM will have value; if not, you have nothing to lose. The only ones with an issue would be those who spent money buying NFTs on the site.\\n\\nAnyway, fingers crossed for you guys too.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8135y63y5fre1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=363b7585e93ed9f934f2d8d5180139245eea8a67\\n\\n', 'author': 'Savi321', 'upvotes': 1, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 1, 'num_comments': 0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1jltalk/torum_shutting_down_v1_and_v2_how_to_claim_your/', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-28 11:54:41+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-03-27 14:54:05+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jl5s7g', 'title': 'How Reddit Crypto-Pilled the COVID Generation with Easy-to-Purchase Collectible Avatars on Polygon PoS', 'body': 'No text body (link post)', 'author': '0xpolygonlabs', 'upvotes': 0, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 0, 'num_comments': 4, 'url': 'https://polygon.technology/blog/how-reddit-crypto-pilled-the-covid-generation-with-easy-to-purchase-collectible-avatars-on-polygon-pos', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-27 14:54:05+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-03-27 14:46:00+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jl5lfb', 'title': 'The $LIBRA Debacle: Political Endorsements Are Driving Rug Pulls', 'body': 'No text body (link post)', 'author': 'goldyluckinblokchain', 'upvotes': 1, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 1, 'num_comments': 0, 'url': 'https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/03/27/the-usdlibra-debacle-political-endorsements-are-driving-rug-pulls', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-27 14:46:00+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'CryptoCurrency'}], Timestamp('2025-03-27 11:20:22+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jl1kby', 'title': 'Hyperliquid facing issues around liquidity and manipulation.', 'body': 'Hyperliquid is facing issues after a trader took a massive position on the $JELLY token, shorting it heavily and pumping its price, causing a $10M+ loss for the platform. \\n\\nThis exposed flaws like excessive leverage and poor risk management.

Upon completion, the researcher rewards one monkey with a cucumber slice, while the other receives a grape – a treat capuchins prefer significantly more than cucumbers.\\n\\nInitially, the monkey given the cucumber accepts it, though perhaps with mild hesitation. But when the experiment is repeated and the same unequal rewards are distributed once again, the cucumber-receiving monkey typically protests – often throwing the cucumber out of their cage (or even back at the researcher) in frustration. Notably, both monkeys are content when they both each receive cucumbers, and they’ll even perform the task without any reward for a time. However, when one is favored in clear sight of the other, the less-rewarded monkey’s resentment is unmistakable.\\n\\nThis behavior reveals a striking insight: a sense of justice is hardwired into us, predating human society and evident even in our primate relatives. On a fundamental, intrinsic, instinctive level, we are reflexively disgusted when we're the recipient of a comparative injustice.\\n\\nHere's where fiat comes in. Suppose your employer asked you to perform the same job as last year, with equal effort, but offered you a lower salary this time. Your immediate reaction would likely be one of instinctive, reflexive disgust. \\n\\nBut what if your pay could be reduced covertly, without triggering this instinctive response? How might that be achieved?\\n\\nIn a fiat system, your employer can 'raise' your salary annually while still effectively paying you less. This is achieved by increasing your pay below the rate needed to match the true decline in your purchasing power. Official inflation figures, like the Consumer Price Index (CPI), underrepresent the rising costs of assets such as housing, stocks, land and business premises, all of which far outpace mass-produced goods in the long run. Your modest salary bump might leave you and your colleagues feeling underwhelmed, but it doesn’t provoke the same raw anger as an outright pay cut.\\n\\nMany assume salaries are determined solely by market forces – supply and demand determining a 'fair' price for your labor. But this is only partially true. You, along with all workers globally, play an active role in valuing your labor. Without some mechanism to disguise your pay cut, you wouldn’t willingly work for less this year than last – your innate sense of fairness would rebel.\\n\\nFiat currency provides the shrowd to mask the injustice. The muted frustration of a 'pay rise' that doesn’t quite keep up with your ability to afford scarce assets – like a home – differs powerfully from the visceral disgust of seeing your paycheck shrink outright. These inadequate 'pay rises' have been occurring globally for over 50 years now. That sense you have that everything is broken is precisely this.\\n\\nAnd in a economic system underpinned by a hard-capped currency like BTC, this deception would be impossible. To reduce your pay, employers would have to lower the nominal amount on your payslip, and everyone else's. The resulting outrage would be swift and collective. Workers would resist en masse.\\n\\nFiat currency concentrates wealth among those who already own substantial assets, whilst those with few or no assets struggle to keep up. It does so by cutting everyone's pay globally, every year. Housing and land and the S&P 500 and rare art and fine wine and the Mona Lisa are not rising in price. Your pay simply keeps falling. This trend will persist unless workers demand compensation in a currency immune to such deception.\\n\\nBitcoin is not rightwing. Those who think it is have not understood it yet.\\n\\nFix the money, fix the world.\", 'author': '__Anomalous__', 'upvotes': 193, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 193, 'num_comments': 175, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jmvxxh/bitcoin_is_not_rightwing/', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-29 20:51:42+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'Bitcoin'}], Timestamp('2025-03-28 14:40:46+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jlwmlt', 'title': 'Time to Buy the dip again', 'body': \"Lets go, buy at 84K .

It does what it’s supposed to now without self promotion from the founders. Since it doesn’t need promotion to thrive, it doesn’t fall victim to the vices of marketing from greedy, charismatic leaders, with overly complex projects. Sure, there’s Saylor and Novogratz that sometimes fall into that role. But bitcoin doesn’t need them to survive and won’t need them when they die. The project works now.

So yeah, deflation bad, Japan etc.\\n\\nThat\\'s because this system is designed to debase money in exchange for \"growth\", in hopes wages keep up with prices etc. \\n\\nTechnically, from the most basic economic standpoint; **deflation is the natural state of a free market.** \\n\\nIf you have a static/sound money, and add value into an economy without the ability to debase the money, then prices naturally fall toward the marginal cost of production. When humans get better at making things and companies compete for your business, prices fall to the margin cost of production. \\n\\nIf there is $10 and 10 apples in an economy, an apple\\'s equilibrium cost in the market will settle at $1. If you add 10 more apples but you can\\'t increase the money supply, those apples would now settle on a cost of $0.50 each. \\n\\nThe opposite is true as well; add $10 and keep the same 10 apples and apples will settle on a cost of $2 each instead of one.   \\n\\nThis is why only tech prices generally fall; because their production outpaces inflation. And yes, even though a TV will cost 1/2 the price in a few months, **people still buy TVs**. If your money got more valuable over time, you would still buy clothes, food, shelter, cars, gas, have kids, etc. The argument that deflation would cause people to stop spending is bullshit. And again don\\'t forget that deflation would be terrible for this system because we must print to continue so that is also where this lie comes from.\\n\\nAlthough we are taught about the different types of inflation, expansion of the money supply is the tide that rises all boats (prices) and the end all be all when it comes to long term inflation. \\n\\nThis is a big reason, and also a big misunderstanding, on why people gain conviction on Bitcoin. You cannot print more, so if it were the money, every time someone produces more value into the economy, prices fall. You cannot let air of the bike tire (debasement) so the value goes to the people who hold the money. Essentially, if Bitcoin had already been the money, as tech advanced and we get better and better at making things, we could ALL work less etc. Instead people need to change jobs, add jobs, work harder just to keep up on the treadmill\\n\\nBitcoin literally stops the treadmill and starts giving the value that used to be stolen via debasement and gives it back to the ones holing the money.\\n\\nThe kicker: Even the ***very last*** person to adopt Bitcoin will see prices around them fall towards the margin cost of production, forever.

Many of us have experienced the rollercoaster of emotions that comes with the market\\'s volatility. We\\'ve seen our investments dip and rise, and some of us have even panicked and sold at a loss. But here\\'s the thing: while we might lose some value temporarily, the potential for recovery is always there.\\r\\r\\n\\nWhen we hold onto our Bitcoin, we’re not just holding a digital asset; we’re holding onto a vision of the future—a future where financial freedom and decentralization are the norms. Every time we choose to hold rather than sell, we’re betting on that future.\\r\\r\\n\\nOn the flip side, think about those who have thrown away their Bitcoin—whether it was due to fear, impatience, or misunderstanding. Those coins are gone forever, and with them, the opportunity to be part of something revolutionary.\\r\\rSo, let’s remind ourselves: in this journey, it’s okay to feel the fear of loss, but let’s not throw away our potential.

But scammers have become so prevalent in the world of \"technical analysis\" that many no longer believe in it.\\n\\nSo, I decided to explain what TA actually is—and what it isn’t.\\n\\nWhat TA isn’t:\\n\\nTA is not a tool for \"predicting the future.\" There is no rule in the world that says, \"If the price hits this support level, it must go up.\" In reality, the price will respect that level about 50% of the time—and the other 50% of the time, it won’t. The market doesn’t care about the lines on your screen.\\n\\n\\nWhat TA is:\\n\\nTA is about using these lines not to predict the future, but to gather information.\\n\\n\\nIf Bitcoin has historically dropped to $78K-$80K before bouncing back, does that mean $78K-$80K is a \"SuPpOrT LeVeL™\"? No. It simply means that most traders—or more importantly, the traders with the most money—look at Bitcoin at that price and think, \"Nice, that\\'s a price I’m willing to pay.\"\\n\\nThis tells you that historically, $78K-$80K has been a good entry point, because buyers have seen Bitcoin as cheap at those levels and were willing to buy.\\n\\nBut that’s true for now. What if, tomorrow, a new pandemic starts? People will have less disposable income and may be forced to sell their BTC holdings. If that happens, the price will likely drop below $78K.\\n\\nAt that point, you\\'ll need to adjust your TA because people will no longer see Bitcoin at $78K as cheap. Due to external factors, $78K could suddenly become expensive, and now most buyers might only be interested at, say, $50K.\\n\\nSo, TA is basically a tool to understand how the market feels about Bitcoin’s price at any given time. But since we’re dealing with human beings, and human emotions can change for all sorts of reasons, TA will never be perfect. That’s why you shouldn’t get too caught up in drawing random lines on a chart—they only tell you what’s happening now, not what will happen in the future.\\n\\nOf course, if you know that what’s happening now will continue into the future, you can make some predictions.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nWe know that governments will continue printing money, because politicians don’t care about their people—they only care about their wallets. Since Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million, while fiat money keeps inflating, Bitcoin’s price will increase in the long run.\\n\\nWe also know that the Bitcoin halving will continue to occur every four years. This means Bitcoin’s supply will keep decreasing, which historically leads to price appreciation.\\n\\n\\nHowever, you can never predict the exact timing of the market in the short to medium term. So instead of trading and losing money—like 100% of traders who aren’t selling online courses on how to “get rich trading”—just Buy and HODL Bitcoin for at least four years (ideally for life) and make money like 100% of long-term HODLers.\\n\\nTL;DR: TA is useful, but HODL is better.', 'author': 'PollabBTC', 'upvotes': 14, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 14, 'num_comments': 13, 'url': 'https://i.redd.it/245ohjucj1re1.png', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-26 14:03:25+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'Bitcoin'}], Timestamp('2025-04-01 19:32:55+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jp4jie', 'title': 'No Team, No Problem: How I’m Building a Bitcoin Wallet as a Solo Founder', 'body': 'No text body (link post)', 'author': 'TristanBietsch', 'upvotes': 14, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 14, 'num_comments': 1, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@tristanbietsch/no-team-no-problem-how-im-building-a-bitcoin-wallet-as-a-solo-founder-6ec1b2d4197b', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-04-01 19:32:55+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'Bitcoin'}], Timestamp('2025-03-29 13:06:24+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jmlvcr', 'title': 'Is Coinbase the way to go?', 'body': 'Heyo!

Price Action & Market Structure\\n\\n* **Trendlines & Breakouts:**\\n   * I frequently track **descending & ascending trendlines** to identify breakout points.\\n   * I **wait for confirmation (candlestick closes) before calling a breakout valid**.\\n   * Retests of key levels **(previous resistance turning into support)** are crucial in my analysis.\\n* **Support & Resistance:**\\n   * I **identify major historical support/resistance zones** and assess **whether price respects them**.\\n   * I look for **wick rejections & consolidation** before determining strength at key levels.\\n* **Candlestick Patterns & Structure:**\\n   * I often **identify reversal patterns (e.g., doji, hammer, engulfing candles)**.\\n   * I pay attention to **volume spikes** at key levels to validate price reactions.\\n\\n# 🔹 2. Moving Averages & Trend Indicators\\n\\n* **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA 50, 100, 200):**\\n   * I use **EMA crossovers for trend shifts** (e.g., EMA 50 crossing below EMA 200 as a bearish sign).\\n   * **EMA support & resistance:** I check how price interacts with moving averages for additional confluence.\\n* **Momentum Indicators:**\\n   * **RSI (14)**\\n      * I check **RSI divergence** to detect possible reversals before they happen.\\n      * RSI above 70 = potential overbought | RSI below 30 = potential oversold.\\n   * **Squeeze Momentum Indicator:**\\n      * I analyze **green/red histogram shifts** to spot potential trend reversals.\\n      * I wait for a **momentum shift confirmation before entering trades**.\\n\\n# 🔹 3. Multi-Timeframe Analysis\\n\\n* **I never rely on a single timeframe** and instead:\\n   * I use the **monthly & weekly charts for trend confirmation**.\\n   * The **daily & 4H charts for precise entries/exits**.\\n   * I check for **alignment across multiple timeframes** before making a decision.\\n\\n# 🔹 4. On-Chain Data Integration\\n\\n* **Whale Transactions:**\\n   * I analyze **whale accumulation/distribution trends** to predict future moves.\\n   * Large inflows to exchanges = **potential selling pressure**.\\n   * Large outflows from exchanges = **accumulation signal**.\\n* **Active Addresses & Network Growth:**\\n   * I check **wallet activity to gauge market participation**.\\n   * High active wallets = **increased interest & volume**.\\n* **DEX & CEX Flow Analysis:**\\n   * I track **exchange inflows/outflows to assess short-term market behavior**.\\n   * Heavy inflows = potential dumps | Heavy outflows = long-term holding.\\n\\n# 🔹 5. Funding Rates & Market Sentiment\\n\\n* **Funding Rate Analysis:**\\n   * I monitor **funding rate spikes to detect overly bullish or bearish sentiment**.\\n   * Negative funding = potential **short squeeze**.\\n   * High positive funding = **potential long squeeze**.\\n* **Open Interest & Liquidation Zones:**\\n   * I check **OI increases/decreases** to confirm trend strength.\\n   * I analyze **liquidation levels** where market makers might push price.\\n\\n# 🔹 6. Fundamental & Ecosystem-Based Analysis\\n\\n* **I integrate key fundamentals before making long-term decisions:**\\n   * **Upcoming Developments (e.g., project updates, partnerships, protocol upgrades).**\\n   * **Tokenomics (supply inflation, staking mechanisms, lock-up periods).**\\n   * **Community Engagement (social sentiment & narrative strength).**\\n\\nIf any of you guys want a complete , short or detailed analysis of an asset , stock , crypto currency .  \\nKindly message me or comment down below .  \\ni don't charge but i accept tips if you are satisfied with my work .  \\nWould be happy to help .\", 'author': 'GulraizRehman', 'upvotes': 0, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 0, 'num_comments': 15, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBetsCrypto/comments/1jkhpqf/my_analysis_approach_kindly_read/', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-03-26 17:41:28+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'WallStreetBetsCrypto'}], Timestamp('2025-04-02 23:37:53+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jq3eex', 'title': 'crypto bottom dip how long will it last', 'body': 'watch a you-tube clip last night and this crypto analyst predicts that the bottom dip will last all of April then by November most coins are going to the the moon but since the tariffs are in not to sure about that one the dip might last longer maybe a extra month then it start to peak any thoughts on this \\n\\n\\n\\nps: buy the dip lmao  ', 'author': 'Latter-Conference-88', 'upvotes': 0, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 0, 'num_comments': 17, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBetsCrypto/comments/1jq3eex/crypto_bottom_dip_how_long_will_it_last/', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-04-02 23:37:53+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'WallStreetBetsCrypto'}], Timestamp('2025-04-01 23:10:30+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jp9s5j', 'title': 'The XRP YouTube Grift', 'body': 'No text body (link post)', 'author': 'slavaMZ', 'upvotes': 0, 'downvotes': 0, 'score': 0, 'num_comments': 5, 'url': 'https://youtu.be/-tHs6Z8jQyM', 'created_at': Timestamp('2025-04-01 23:10:30+0000', tz='UTC'), 'subreddit': 'WallStreetBetsCrypto'}], Timestamp('2025-03-30 16:02:11+0000', tz='UTC'): [{'post_id': '1jnfnpj', 'title': \"Woke up and closed with a small Sunday gain while listening to paganini, friends.

         "BCH had a compliant stable USD — USDh — years ago, yet the service was eventually discontinued. \n\nMUSD is good, but in my opinion, compliant stable USDs have unique advantages.\n\nObviously, neither USDT nor any other stable USD is likely to launch on the BCH chain, for two reasons:\n\t1.\tBTC supporters are highly skilled at playing politics, making negative PR almost inevitable if anyone dares to issue USDT on BCH.\n\t2.\tThere are very few users or on-chain activities on BCH, which makes it commercially unappealing. \n\nLaunching and maintaining a new compliant stable USD is expensive — it costs around $100,000 per year.\n\nSo here’s the real question:\nIf a company is willing to bear both the cost and the backlash from BTC supporters to provide this infrastructure, will it be fully supported by the BCH community?\n\nOr will it instead be dismissed with comments like:\n\t“It’s useless, people can just pay with BCH directly.”\n\t“Just another trick to maintain fiat/dollar hegemony.”\n\t“It’s centralized, so it can be frozen or blacklisted.”\n       \"BCH works perfectly now. Better than Stable USD.\"\n\nThat is, if a company is willing to make such sacrifices, will it at least earn the admiration from a small group of people?",

         "A long time ago I had got myself some BTC in a Samourai wallet and after not looking at it for a while found that it was completely empty with 0 transaction history. I didn't look into it at all and naively figured I had been hacked or something. Only now, years later have I decided to look into it and discovered that FBI business and the hopeful fact that my money could still be out there.\n\nI've been trying to recover it first via Sparrow and now Blue wallet on my phone, both to no avail.\n\nI've tried exporting the backup txt file from Samourai and importing that into Sparrow with all different script types, no dice.\n\nI've tried the 12 word mnemonic and passphrase with Sparrow telling me it could not find a wallet with existing transactions. Blue wallet was able to find a wallet with those 12 words but same result as every other attempt, empty wallet with no transaction history whatsoever.\n\nI'm wondering what to do in this scenario as a complete beginner who knows literally nothing and understands less.\n\nAlso, what are the odds that my money is actually just gone?\n\nThank you\n\nDon't DM me ",

Are we being played to make his buddies rich somehow?\n\nThe reason I ask is because Trump doesn't know jack shit about bitcoin, and he certainly isn't about decentralization or the people's financial freedom, or the btc community\n\nMichael Saylor always tells us gold is too heavy to carry. If this administration uses our gold to purchase BTC, how do we keep the keys safe from this administration?",

         "I came across a quote recently that really resonated with me: \"Whatever you lose, you’ll find it again. But what you throw away you’ll never get back.\" - Kenshin Himura\n\nIn the world of Bitcoin, this couldn't be more relevant. Many of us have experienced the rollercoaster of emotions that comes with the market's volatility. We've seen our investments dip and rise, and some of us have even panicked and sold at a loss. But here's the thing: while we might lose some value temporarily, the potential for recovery is always there.\r\r\n\nWhen we hold onto our Bitcoin, we’re not just holding a digital asset; we’re holding onto a vision of the future—a future where financial freedom and decentralization are the norms. Every time we choose to hold rather than sell, we’re betting on that future.\r\r\n\nOn the flip side, think about those who have thrown away their Bitcoin—whether it was due to fear, impatience, or misunderstanding. Those coins are gone forever, and with them, the opportunity to be part of something revolutionary.\r\rSo, let’s remind ourselves: in this journey, it’s okay to feel the fear of loss, but let’s not throw away our potential. The market will fluctuate, but our belief in Bitcoin’s value should remain steadfast.",

And now about 16 years later, that idea has become so well known to people. Some joke about it, some embrace it, you know 🤷🏼‍♂️.\n\nBut it really struck my mind again that this idea actually gained so much traction.\n\nIt’s being used as a digital form of gold. And it’s being used as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, without an intermediary, and it’s actually being used like that.\n\nWhen you think about it, it is so mindblowing!\n\nSo yeah, that was my ride to work this morning 😄\n",

         "Hey everyone, l've been thinking about Bitcoin lately. There's something like 70 million millionaires in the world now, which is wild to me. So what if just a small chunk of them, maybe 5 to 10 percent, so around 3.5 to 7 million people, decided to buy at least 1 BTC each? I'm curious why we don't see this happening more often. Are they scared off by the volatility, or do they just not understand btc or crypto in general? I mean, if Bitcoin's sitting around $88k or so, that's pocket change for some of them, right?\n\nThen there's the supply question that's been bugging me. Bitcoin's capped at 21 million coins total, and most of that's already mined, but l've read a bunch are lost forever, like from old wallets people can't access. So if millions of millionaires jumped in to grab a coin each, would there be enough Bitcoin left? Or would the price just shoot through the roof because there's not enough to meet the demand? I'm not a finance guru or anything, just someone who likes pondering this stuff.",

         "So recently, I decided to invest in the crypto market using the principles from Benjamin Graham’s book The Intelligent Investor. If you don’t know, Graham is known as the father of value investing. The book was first published in 1949, gets revised every decade or so, and has been praised by Warren Buffett (arguably the greatest inventor of all time), who called it \"by far the best book about investing ever written.\"\n\nFor context, Buffett started with just $20K at 21 and turned that into $109B by 92, all by following these principles.\n\nAfter reading the book, I decided all in on the RWA (Real-World Asset) sector on 5 specific coins I considered to follow the book’s principles the most and was surprised at how little my portfolio dropped over the last two months, especially compared to the rest of the market. Tonight, I got curious and asked ChatGPT:\n\n\"If Benjamin Graham invested in crypto today (March 26, 2025), what would his portfolio look like?\"\n\nTo my surprise, every coin I picked was on the list. Not gonna name them so I don’t sound like I’m shilling.\n\nIt really made me wonder what the crypto market would look like if more retail investors actually followed value investing principles instead of gambling on meme coins and chasing XRP hopium.\n\nMight be worth checking out The Intelligent Investor if you’re new to investing and or wanna do better in crypto market. \n\nTBH i don’t know if following these principles will work in crypto in the long run, with the market being so volatile, all and filled with so many investors who don’t really understand how to invest (I want to say investors even though they’re all treating it like gambling!) and overall different environment, but it might just push the crypto market enough to start brining in some serious institutional investors. \n\nAlso if you want to know what the key principles are in the book, just google or ChatGPT it, I don’t wanna make this post too long.",

The problem is obviously that it's non-trivial to swap from one custodian to another.\n\nI imagine with how lucrative they are every financial institution will want to have their own, plus a bunch of random people with influence. And realistically this is a perfect job for the treasury.\n\nSeems like this is going to dilute the stablecoin market and make it way less useful. It's really a shame.",

         "The rise of Bitcoin as a high-growth asset is fundamentally changing how companies and valuations are structured. Traditional metrics like P/ E ratios and book value no longer apply in the same way, especially for companies like MicroStrategy (MSTR) that hold Bitcoin as a strategic asset. ◆ Why does MSTR trade at a premium? ◆ How does Bitcoin exposure create asymmetric upside for companies? ◆ Will BTC repricing force a shift in how investors value companies like Tesla, Apple, and Nvidia? Bitcoin's scarcity and institutional adoption are reshaping financial markets. Watch now to understand how corporate valuation models are evolving in the Bitcoin era",

Does the RSI indicator adjust over time to this new price or does it remain WAY overbought from an analysis perspective? I was curious on this after never having thought of it before and never really paying much attention to the RSI until recently. \n\nDoes anyone have any good information on this or advice one way or the other on RSI correction?

         "A long time ago I had got myself some BTC in a Samourai wallet and after not looking at it for a while found that it was completely empty with 0 transaction history. I didn't look into it at all and naively figured I had been hacked or something. Only now, years later have I decided to look into it and discovered that FBI business and the hopeful fact that my money could still be out there.\n\nI've been trying to recover it first via Sparrow and now Blue wallet on my phone, both to no avail.\n\nI've tried exporting the backup txt file from Samourai and importing that into Sparrow with all different script types, no dice.\n\nI've tried the 12 word mnemonic and passphrase with Sparrow telling me it could not find a wallet with existing transactions. Blue wallet was able to find a wallet with those 12 words but same result as every other attempt, empty wallet with no transaction history whatsoever.\n\nI'm wondering what to do in this scenario as a complete beginner who knows literally nothing and understands less.\n\nAlso, what are the odds that my money is actually just gone?\n\nThank you\n\nDon't DM me ",

         "We all know that Trump is taking down our democracy and pushing a fascist rule. His elite buddies are rich AF and those types need more wealth. How does Bitcoin factor in all this? Trump has been blowing real hard to set the sail for Bitcoin. Why? Are we being played to make his buddies rich somehow?\n\nThe reason I ask is because Trump doesn't know jack shit about bitcoin, and he certainly isn't about decentralization or the people's financial freedom, or the btc community\n\nMichael Saylor always tells us gold is too heavy to carry. If this administration uses our gold to purchase BTC, how do we keep the keys safe from this administration?",

         "I came across a quote recently that really resonated with me: \"Whatever you lose, you’ll find it again. But what you throw away you’ll never get back.\" - Kenshin Himura\n\nIn the world of Bitcoin, this couldn't be more relevant. Many of us have experienced the rollercoaster of emotions that comes with the market's volatility. We've seen our investments dip and rise, and some of us have even panicked and sold at a loss. But here's the thing: while we might lose some value temporarily, the potential for recovery is always there.\r\r\n\nWhen we hold onto our Bitcoin, we’re not just holding a digital asset; we’re holding onto a vision of the future—a future where financial freedom and decentralization are the norms. Every time we choose to hold rather than sell, we’re betting on that future.\r\r\n\nOn the flip side, think about those who have thrown away their Bitcoin—whether it was due to fear, impatience, or misunderstanding. Those coins are gone forever, and with them, the opportunity to be part of something revolutionary.\r\rSo, let’s remind ourselves: in this journey, it’s okay to feel the fear of loss, but let’s not throw away our potential. The market will fluctuate, but our belief in Bitcoin’s value should remain steadfast.",

And now about 16 years later, that idea has become so well known to people. Some joke about it, some embrace it, you know 🤷🏼‍♂️.\n\nBut it really struck my mind again that this idea actually gained so much traction.\n\nIt’s being used as a digital form of gold. And it’s being used as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, without an intermediary, and it’s actually being used like that.\n\nWhen you think about it, it is so mindblowing!\n\nSo yeah, that was my ride to work this morning 😄\n",

         "Hey everyone, l've been thinking about Bitcoin lately. There's something like 70 million millionaires in the world now, which is wild to me. So what if just a small chunk of them, maybe 5 to 10 percent, so around 3.5 to 7 million people, decided to buy at least 1 BTC each? I'm curious why we don't see this happening more often. Are they scared off by the volatility, or do they just not understand btc or crypto in general? I mean, if Bitcoin's sitting around $88k or so, that's pocket change for some of them, right?\n\nThen there's the supply question that's been bugging me. Bitcoin's capped at 21 million coins total, and most of that's already mined, but l've read a bunch are lost forever, like from old wallets people can't access. So if millions of millionaires jumped in to grab a coin each, would there be enough Bitcoin left? Or would the price just shoot through the roof because there's not enough to meet the demand? I'm not a finance guru or anything, just someone who likes pondering this stuff.",

         "So recently, I decided to invest in the crypto market using the principles from Benjamin Graham’s book The Intelligent Investor. If you don’t know, Graham is known as the father of value investing. The book was first published in 1949, gets revised every decade or so, and has been praised by Warren Buffett (arguably the greatest inventor of all time), who called it \"by far the best book about investing ever written.\"\n\nFor context, Buffett started with just $20K at 21 and turned that into $109B by 92, all by following these principles.\n\nAfter reading the book, I decided all in on the RWA (Real-World Asset) sector on 5 specific coins I considered to follow the book’s principles the most and was surprised at how little my portfolio dropped over the last two months, especially compared to the rest of the market. Tonight, I got curious and asked ChatGPT:\n\n\"If Benjamin Graham invested in crypto today (March 26, 2025), what would his portfolio look like?\"\n\nTo my surprise, every coin I picked was on the list. Not gonna name them so I don’t sound like I’m shilling.\n\nIt really made me wonder what the crypto market would look like if more retail investors actually followed value investing principles instead of gambling on meme coins and chasing XRP hopium.\n\nMight be worth checking out The Intelligent Investor if you’re new to investing and or wanna do better in crypto market. \n\nTBH i don’t know if following these principles will work in crypto in the long run, with the market being so volatile, all and filled with so many investors who don’t really understand how to invest (I want to say investors even though they’re all treating it like gambling!) and overall different environment, but it might just push the crypto market enough to start brining in some serious institutional investors. \n\nAlso if you want to know what the key principles are in the book, just google or ChatGPT it, I don’t wanna make this post too long.",

PayPal has one that nobody uses.\n\nThere's some really easy money in stablecoins. Management scales easily, but the return goes up with adoption. The problem is obviously that it's non-trivial to swap from one custodian to another.\n\nI imagine with how lucrative they are every financial institution will want to have their own, plus a bunch of random people with influence. And realistically this is a perfect job for the treasury.\n\nSeems like this is going to dilute the stablecoin market and make it way less useful. It's really a shame.",

Traditional metrics like P/ E ratios and book value no longer apply in the same way, especially for companies like MicroStrategy (MSTR) that hold Bitcoin as a strategic asset. ◆ Why does MSTR trade at a premium? ◆ How does Bitcoin exposure create asymmetric upside for companies? ◆ Will BTC repricing force a shift in how investors value companies like Tesla, Apple, and Nvidia? Bitcoin's scarcity and institutional adoption are reshaping financial markets. Watch now to understand how corporate valuation models are evolving in the Bitcoin era",

         "A long time ago I had got myself some BTC in a Samourai wallet and after not looking at it for a while found that it was completely empty with 0 transaction history. I didn't look into it at all and naively figured I had been hacked or something. Only now, years later have I decided to look into it and discovered that FBI business and the hopeful fact that my money could still be out there.\n\nI've been trying to recover it first via Sparrow and now Blue wallet on my phone, both to no avail.\n\nI've tried exporting the backup txt file from Samourai and importing that into Sparrow with all different script types, no dice.\n\nI've tried the 12 word mnemonic and passphrase with Sparrow telling me it could not find a wallet with existing transactions. Blue wallet was able to find a wallet with those 12 words but same result as every other attempt, empty wallet with no transaction history whatsoever.\n\nI'm wondering what to do in this scenario as a complete beginner who knows literally nothing and understands less.\n\nAlso, what are the odds that my money is actually just gone?\n\nThank you\n\nDon't DM me ",

         "I came across a quote recently that really resonated with me: \"Whatever you lose, you’ll find it again. But what you throw away you’ll never get back.\" - Kenshin Himura\n\nIn the world of Bitcoin, this couldn't be more relevant. Many of us have experienced the rollercoaster of emotions that comes with the market's volatility. We've seen our investments dip and rise, and some of us have even panicked and sold at a loss. But here's the thing: while we might lose some value temporarily, the potential for recovery is always there.\r\r\n\nWhen we hold onto our Bitcoin, we’re not just holding a digital asset; we’re holding onto a vision of the future—a future where financial freedom and decentralization are the norms. Every time we choose to hold rather than sell, we’re betting on that future.\r\r\n\nOn the flip side, think about those who have thrown away their Bitcoin—whether it was due to fear, impatience, or misunderstanding. Those coins are gone forever, and with them, the opportunity to be part of something revolutionary.\r\rSo, let’s remind ourselves: in this journey, it’s okay to feel the fear of loss, but let’s not throw away our potential. The market will fluctuate, but our belief in Bitcoin’s value should remain steadfast.",

And now about 16 years later, that idea has become so well known to people. Some joke about it, some embrace it, you know 🤷🏼‍♂️.\n\nBut it really struck my mind again that this idea actually gained so much traction.\n\nIt’s being used as a digital form of gold. And it’s being used as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, without an intermediary, and it’s actually being used like that.\n\nWhen you think about it, it is so mindblowing!\n\nSo yeah, that was my ride to work this morning 😄\n",

         "Hey everyone, l've been thinking about Bitcoin lately. There's something like 70 million millionaires in the world now, which is wild to me. So what if just a small chunk of them, maybe 5 to 10 percent, so around 3.5 to 7 million people, decided to buy at least 1 BTC each? I'm curious why we don't see this happening more often. Are they scared off by the volatility, or do they just not understand btc or crypto in general? I mean, if Bitcoin's sitting around $88k or so, that's pocket change for some of them, right?\n\nThen there's the supply question that's been bugging me. Bitcoin's capped at 21 million coins total, and most of that's already mined, but l've read a bunch are lost forever, like from old wallets people can't access. So if millions of millionaires jumped in to grab a coin each, would there be enough Bitcoin left? Or would the price just shoot through the roof because there's not enough to meet the demand? I'm not a finance guru or anything, just someone who likes pondering this stuff.",

         "So recently, I decided to invest in the crypto market using the principles from Benjamin Graham’s book The Intelligent Investor. If you don’t know, Graham is known as the father of value investing. The book was first published in 1949, gets revised every decade or so, and has been praised by Warren Buffett (arguably the greatest inventor of all time), who called it \"by far the best book about investing ever written.\"\n\nFor context, Buffett started with just $20K at 21 and turned that into $109B by 92, all by following these principles.\n\nAfter reading the book, I decided all in on the RWA (Real-World Asset) sector on 5 specific coins I considered to follow the book’s principles the most and was surprised at how little my portfolio dropped over the last two months, especially compared to the rest of the market. Tonight, I got curious and asked ChatGPT:\n\n\"If Benjamin Graham invested in crypto today (March 26, 2025), what would his portfolio look like?\"\n\nTo my surprise, every coin I picked was on the list. Not gonna name them so I don’t sound like I’m shilling.\n\nIt really made me wonder what the crypto market would look like if more retail investors actually followed value investing principles instead of gambling on meme coins and chasing XRP hopium.\n\nMight be worth checking out The Intelligent Investor if you’re new to investing and or wanna do better in crypto market. \n\nTBH i don’t know if following these principles will work in crypto in the long run, with the market being so volatile, all and filled with so many investors who don’t really understand how to invest (I want to say investors even though they’re all treating it like gambling!) and overall different environment, but it might just push the crypto market enough to start brining in some serious institutional investors. \n\nAlso if you want to know what the key principles are in the book, just google or ChatGPT it, I don’t wanna make this post too long.",

         "\"What Technical Analysis Isn’t vs. What It Actually Is",
         "Normally, when people see someone drawing lines on a chart, they get intrigued. But scammers have become so prevalent in the world of \"technical analysis\" that many no longer believe in it.\n\nSo, I decided to explain what TA actually is—and what it isn’t.\n\nWhat TA isn’t:\n\nTA is not a tool for \"predicting the future.\" There is no rule in the world that says, \"If the price hits this support level, it must go up.\" In reality, the price will respect that level about 50% of the time—and the other 50% of the time, it won’t. The market doesn’t care about the lines on your screen.\n\n\nWhat TA is:\n\nTA is about using these lines not to predict the future, but to gather information.\n\n\nIf Bitcoin has historically dropped to $78K-$80K before bouncing back, does that mean $78K-$80K is a \"SuPpOrT LeVeL™\"? No. It simply means that most traders—or more importantly, the traders with the most money—look at Bitcoin at that price and think, \"Nice, that's a price I’m willing to pay.\"\n\nThis tells you that historically, $78K-$80K has been a good entry point, because buyers have seen Bitcoin as cheap at those levels and were willing to buy.\n\nBut that’s true for now. What if, tomorrow, a new pandemic starts? People will have less disposable income and may be forced to sell their BTC holdings. If that happens, the price will likely drop below $78K.\n\nAt that point, you'll need to adjust your TA because people will no longer see Bitcoin at $78K as cheap. Due to external factors, $78K could suddenly become expensive, and now most buyers might only be interested at, say, $50K.\n\nSo, TA is basically a tool to understand how the market feels about Bitcoin’s price at any given time. But since we’re dealing with human beings, and human emotions can change for all sorts of reasons, TA will never be perfect. That’s why you shouldn’t get too caught up in drawing random lines on a chart—they only tell you what’s happening now, not what will happen in the future.\n\nOf course, if you know that what’s happening now will continue into the future, you can make some predictions.\n\nFor example:\n\nWe know that governments will continue printing money, because politicians don’t care about their people—they only care about their wallets. Since Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million, while fiat money keeps inflating, Bitcoin’s price will increase in the long run.\n\nWe also know that the Bitcoin halving will continue to occur every four years. This means Bitcoin’s supply will keep decreasing, which historically leads to price appreciation.\n\n\nHowever, you can never predict the exact timing of the market in the short to medium term. So instead of trading and losing money—like 100% of traders who aren’t selling online courses on how to “get rich trading”—just Buy and HODL Bitcoin for at least four years (ideally for life) and make money like 100% of long-term HODLers.\n\nTL;DR: TA is useful, but HODL is better.",

Which will give you the best user experience. \n\nTo do this we have created a short survey (< 2 minutes to fill in) we would really appreciate it if you could fill it in 🙏 \n\nhttps://conjointly.online/study/589565/5wyyesiqcu63st2no97s\n\nI am also open to have a discussion about it!\n\nMy own view on research. Is that it’s harder than I thought to keep my notes organized and structured. I mostly use notion but even that becomes a mess after a couple days. \nBesides, it is also not optimal for my crypto research. Do you know any good templates or anything to use? \nHow do you take track of your research and note-taking? \n\nI also have often that I have some notes in whatsapp, some in notes, others in notion and that becomes really messy over time. Do you experience the same or what systems do you have in place to make sure that doesn’t happens?",

         "Is this true \n\nTo determine how fast you could mine 0.02 bitcoins at a hash rate of 200 GH/s, you need to consider a few factors, including the Bitcoin network's current difficulty level and the block reward.\n### Current Context\n1. **Hash Rate**: 200 GH/s (200 billion hashes per second).\n2. **Bitcoin Block Reward**: As of now, the block reward is 6.25 bitcoins per block (this reward halves approximately every four years, with the next halving expected in 2024).\n3. **Bitcoin Network Difficulty**: This is a measure of how difficult it is to find a new block. The network adjusts the difficulty approximately every two weeks to ensure that a block is mined roughly every 10 minutes.\n### Calculations\n1. **Network Hash Rate**: The total hash rate of the Bitcoin network can influence how long it takes to mine new coins. For this example, let's assume the current network hash rate is around 300 EH/s (300,000,000 GH/s), which is a rough estimate.\n2. **Probability of Finding a Block**: The probability of your mining operation (200 GH/s) finding a block can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Your Hash Rate}}{\\text{Network Hash Rate}} = \\frac{200 \\text{ GH/s}}{300,000,000 \\text{ GH/s}} \\approx 0.0000006667\n   \\]\n3. **Expected Number of Blocks**: Knowing that it takes about 10 minutes to find a block on average, the expected time to find one block is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Time to Find One Block (in minutes)} = \\frac{10 \\text{ minutes}}{0.0000006667} \\approx 15,000,000 \\text{ minutes} \\approx 28.5 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n4. **Mining 0.02 Bitcoin**: Since the block reward is 6.25 bitcoins per block, you would need to mine a portion of a block to get 0.02 bitcoins:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Time to Mine 0.02 Bitcoin} \\approx \\frac{0.02 \\text{ Bitcoin}}{6.25 \\text{ Bitcoin/block}} \\times 15,000,000 \\text{ minutes} \\approx 48,000 \\text{ minutes} \\approx 33.3 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n### Summary\nAt a hash rate of 200 GH/s, it is estimated that you would take approximately **33.3 days** to mine **0.02 bitcoins**, assuming constant network difficulty and no changes in the hash rate. Keep in mind that fluctuations in network difficulty, competition, and mining rewards can significantly impact this estimate.",

         "\"USDC has hit a record market capitalization of **$60.2 billion**, doubling in value over the past year.\n\nAs a result, the total stablecoin market cap has also reached a new all-time high, climbing past $230 billion. For comparison, the stablecoin market first went beyond the $200 billion mark in December 2024.\n\nThe surge in USDC’s market cap to $60.2 billion reflects Circle’s ongoing efforts to scale its infrastructure and broaden the token’s global adoption.\n\nUSDC remains the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, behind only Tether (USDT), which currently exceeds $144 billion.\n\nA major driver of USDC’s expansion has been Circle’s multichain strategy. Several key blockchain networks now integrate the stablecoin, including:\n\n* ***Ethereum (over $36 billion)***\n* ***Solana ($10 billion)***\n* ***Base ($3.8 billion)***\n* ***Hyperliquid ($2.2 billion)***\n* ***Arbitrum ($1.8 billion)***\n* ***Berachain ($1 billion)*** \n\n[The source](https://coinomist.com/news/usdc-reaches-60-billion-market-cap/)  \n",

         "\"One of the most promising areas of neobanking development is the integration of cryptocurrency services. Today, more and more neobanks are offering their users the opportunity to buy, sell, and use cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions. There are several reasons for this:\n\n– **Demand creates supply.** Every year, the number of cryptocurrency users is growing, and at the same time, more and more people are considering crypto as an alternative to traditional payment solutions. Neobanks are taking advantage of this opportunity and offering relevant services to meet the needs of their customers.\n\n– **Providing faster and cheaper transactions.** One of the advantages of cryptocurrencies is their decentralized nature, which eliminates the need for intermediaries such as traditional banks. As a result, transaction costs and processing speeds are reduced, which contributes to the efficiency of cross-border payments.\n\n– **Transparency and security of the blockchain.** Blockchain technology ensures transparency and high reliability, as each transaction is visible to all network participants and can be verified and confirmed.\n\n– **Portfolio diversification.** Neobanks give users the opportunity to store both fiat and crypto assets, which allows them to diversify their portfolio and manage it through one platform.\"\n\n  \n*Do you think neobanks have a real chance to lead crypto adoption?*\n\n[Full source](https://36crypto.com/neobanks-vs-traditional-banks-whos-winning-the-crypto-race/)",

Or is this an unexpected consequence of tying energy with the only asset that’s fixed im supply? \n\nAny insights here appreciated ",

         "A long time ago I had got myself some BTC in a Samourai wallet and after not looking at it for a while found that it was completely empty with 0 transaction history. I didn't look into it at all and naively figured I had been hacked or something. Only now, years later have I decided to look into it and discovered that FBI business and the hopeful fact that my money could still be out there.\n\nI've been trying to recover it first via Sparrow and now Blue wallet on my phone, both to no avail.\n\nI've tried exporting the backup txt file from Samourai and importing that into Sparrow with all different script types, no dice.\n\nI've tried the 12 word mnemonic and passphrase with Sparrow telling me it could not find a wallet with existing transactions. Blue wallet was able to find a wallet with those 12 words but same result as every other attempt, empty wallet with no transaction history whatsoever.\n\nI'm wondering what to do in this scenario as a complete beginner who knows literally nothing and understands less.\n\nAlso, what are the odds that my money is actually just gone?\n\nThank you\n\nDon't DM me ",

         "I came across a quote recently that really resonated with me: \"Whatever you lose, you’ll find it again. But what you throw away you’ll never get back.\" - Kenshin Himura\n\nIn the world of Bitcoin, this couldn't be more relevant. Many of us have experienced the rollercoaster of emotions that comes with the market's volatility. We've seen our investments dip and rise, and some of us have even panicked and sold at a loss. But here's the thing: while we might lose some value temporarily, the potential for recovery is always there.\r\r\n\nWhen we hold onto our Bitcoin, we’re not just holding a digital asset; we’re holding onto a vision of the future—a future where financial freedom and decentralization are the norms. Every time we choose to hold rather than sell, we’re betting on that future.\r\r\n\nOn the flip side, think about those who have thrown away their Bitcoin—whether it was due to fear, impatience, or misunderstanding. Those coins are gone forever, and with them, the opportunity to be part of something revolutionary.\r\rSo, let’s remind ourselves: in this journey, it’s okay to feel the fear of loss, but let’s not throw away our potential. The market will fluctuate, but our belief in Bitcoin’s value should remain steadfast.",

(Fun Fact: \"Salary\" comes from *sal*, which is Latin for salt.) For example, beads were used as a medium of barter within and among communities in Africa. For the natives, the beads were hard money since they were difficult to make, keeping their supply-to-stock ratio in check. They met the three most important criteria for money: **saleability across time, space, and scale**.\\n\\n* **Time:** The beads didn\\'t lose value or deteriorate.\\n* **Space:** They were easy to transport due to their lightweight nature.\\n* **Scale:** They were easily divisible.\\n\\nHowever, they only retained their value while their supply remained scarce. When Europeans started mass-manufacturing the beads and using them to buy African resources cheaply, the supply rapidly increased, causing their value to collapse. The same trade beads, once considered valuable, were later used as \"slave beads\" in the transatlantic slave trade—a very sad story with an important lesson about the stock-to-flow ratio and hardness of money', 'Because you wrote words that come to my mind, but I could not write them down as you did, anyway, support exploration and analysis, and thank you🙏', 'No idea who that is.

         "Hey everyone, l've been thinking about Bitcoin lately. There's something like 70 million millionaires in the world now, which is wild to me. So what if just a small chunk of them, maybe 5 to 10 percent, so around 3.5 to 7 million people, decided to buy at least 1 BTC each? I'm curious why we don't see this happening more often. Are they scared off by the volatility, or do they just not understand btc or crypto in general? I mean, if Bitcoin's sitting around $88k or so, that's pocket change for some of them, right?\n\nThen there's the supply question that's been bugging me. Bitcoin's capped at 21 million coins total, and most of that's already mined, but l've read a bunch are lost forever, like from old wallets people can't access. So if millions of millionaires jumped in to grab a coin each, would there be enough Bitcoin left? Or would the price just shoot through the roof because there's not enough to meet the demand? I'm not a finance guru or anything, just someone who likes pondering this stuff.",

         "Benjamin Graham strategy",
         "So recently, I decided to invest in the crypto market using the principles from Benjamin Graham’s book The Intelligent Investor. If you don’t know, Graham is known as the father of value investing. The book was first published in 1949, gets revised every decade or so, and has been praised by Warren Buffett (arguably the greatest inventor of all time), who called it \"by far the best book about investing ever written.\"\n\nFor context, Buffett started with just $20K at 21 and turned that into $109B by 92, all by following these principles.\n\nAfter reading the book, I decided all in on the RWA (Real-World Asset) sector on 5 specific coins I considered to follow the book’s principles the most and was surprised at how little my portfolio dropped over the last two months, especially compared to the rest of the market. Tonight, I got curious and asked ChatGPT:\n\n\"If Benjamin Graham invested in crypto today (March 26, 2025), what would his portfolio look like?\"\n\nTo my surprise, every coin I picked was on the list. Not gonna name them so I don’t sound like I’m shilling.\n\nIt really made me wonder what the crypto market would look like if more retail investors actually followed value investing principles instead of gambling on meme coins and chasing XRP hopium.\n\nMight be worth checking out The Intelligent Investor if you’re new to investing and or wanna do better in crypto market. \n\nTBH i don’t know if following these principles will work in crypto in the long run, with the market being so volatile, all and filled with so many investors who don’t really understand how to invest (I want to say investors even though they’re all treating it like gambling!) and overall different environment, but it might just push the crypto market enough to start brining in some serious institutional investors. \n\nAlso if you want to know what the key principles are in the book, just google or ChatGPT it, I don’t wanna make this post too long.",

         "['Here are five cryptocurrencies that Graham might consider based on these principles:\\n\\nBTC\\nETH\\nBNB\\nADA\\nLINK\\n\\nBitcoin (BTC): As the first and most established cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has the largest market capitalization and is widely regarded as „digital gold.“ Its limited supply (21 million coins) and decentralized nature could appeal to Graham’s belief in investing in assets with strong, long-term value. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum has a strong use case in supporting decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. With the Ethereum network undergoing significant upgrades (such as Ethereum 2.0), it could be seen as a blockchain with long-term growth potential. Binance Coin (BNB): Binance Coin is the native token of the Binance exchange, which is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Its utility and growth potential, coupled with the success of Binance as a platform, might appeal to Graham as it has established itself as a significant player in the ecosystem. Cardano (ADA): Known for its research-driven approach and focus on scalability and sustainability, Cardano could be seen as a blockchain project with a strong technological foundation. Graham might appreciate its focus on security, peer-reviewed research, and academic rigor. Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink provides decentralized oracles, which are essential for connecting smart contracts with real-world data. With its unique niche in the crypto space, Graham could view Chainlink as an essential infrastructure play with real-world utility and long-term value. Graham would likely avoid highly speculative or „pump and dump“ coins and instead focus on those that show solid use cases, adoption, and the potential for growth based on fundamentals.', \"BNB?

The US will be leading the tokenisation of assets (due to be the only country with a legal framework).

         "The rise of Bitcoin as a high-growth asset is fundamentally changing how companies and valuations are structured. Traditional metrics like P/ E ratios and book value no longer apply in the same way, especially for companies like MicroStrategy (MSTR) that hold Bitcoin as a strategic asset. ◆ Why does MSTR trade at a premium? ◆ How does Bitcoin exposure create asymmetric upside for companies? ◆ Will BTC repricing force a shift in how investors value companies like Tesla, Apple, and Nvidia? Bitcoin's scarcity and institutional adoption are reshaping financial markets. Watch now to understand how corporate valuation models are evolving in the Bitcoin era",

         "\"What Technical Analysis Isn’t vs. What It Actually Is",
         "Normally, when people see someone drawing lines on a chart, they get intrigued. But scammers have become so prevalent in the world of \"technical analysis\" that many no longer believe in it.\n\nSo, I decided to explain what TA actually is—and what it isn’t.\n\nWhat TA isn’t:\n\nTA is not a tool for \"predicting the future.\" There is no rule in the world that says, \"If the price hits this support level, it must go up.\" In reality, the price will respect that level about 50% of the time—and the other 50% of the time, it won’t. The market doesn’t care about the lines on your screen.\n\n\nWhat TA is:\n\nTA is about using these lines not to predict the future, but to gather information.\n\n\nIf Bitcoin has historically dropped to $78K-$80K before bouncing back, does that mean $78K-$80K is a \"SuPpOrT LeVeL™\"? No. It simply means that most traders—or more importantly, the traders with the most money—look at Bitcoin at that price and think, \"Nice, that's a price I’m willing to pay.\"\n\nThis tells you that historically, $78K-$80K has been a good entry point, because buyers have seen Bitcoin as cheap at those levels and were willing to buy.\n\nBut that’s true for now. What if, tomorrow, a new pandemic starts? People will have less disposable income and may be forced to sell their BTC holdings. If that happens, the price will likely drop below $78K.\n\nAt that point, you'll need to adjust your TA because people will no longer see Bitcoin at $78K as cheap. Due to external factors, $78K could suddenly become expensive, and now most buyers might only be interested at, say, $50K.\n\nSo, TA is basically a tool to understand how the market feels about Bitcoin’s price at any given time. But since we’re dealing with human beings, and human emotions can change for all sorts of reasons, TA will never be perfect. That’s why you shouldn’t get too caught up in drawing random lines on a chart—they only tell you what’s happening now, not what will happen in the future.\n\nOf course, if you know that what’s happening now will continue into the future, you can make some predictions.\n\nFor example:\n\nWe know that governments will continue printing money, because politicians don’t care about their people—they only care about their wallets. Since Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million, while fiat money keeps inflating, Bitcoin’s price will increase in the long run.\n\nWe also know that the Bitcoin halving will continue to occur every four years. This means Bitcoin’s supply will keep decreasing, which historically leads to price appreciation.\n\n\nHowever, you can never predict the exact timing of the market in the short to medium term. So instead of trading and losing money—like 100% of traders who aren’t selling online courses on how to “get rich trading”—just Buy and HODL Bitcoin for at least four years (ideally for life) and make money like 100% of long-term HODLers.\n\nTL;DR: TA is useful, but HODL is better.",

Some of them are bound to \"be right\" just because there\\'s so many of them and because all possible angles are covered. One of them is bound to \"predict\" it correctly. Moreover, a lot of the traders make both bull and bear cases in the same video based on the same data.\\n\\nHow is TA useful, then? It\\'s basically saying \"I have no idea what\\'s coming next\", but with a ton of extra steps. To quote you: \"The market doesn’t care about the lines on your screen.\"', '>It simply means that most traders—or more importantly, the traders with the most money—look at Bitcoin at that price and think, \"Nice, that\\'s a price I’m willing to pay.\"\\n\\n\\nAKA support level', 'Do you have at least 5 years of trading and at least 1000 trades to test if you have more than 50% success rate?\\n\\nIf you flip a coin 10 times you can get 10 tails, but if you flip it 1000 times you will get closer to 500/500.', 'Also, a computer can recognize these patterns a million times faster if there was profit in it.', \"It's useful to know what most people (or people with the most money) in the market are feeling right now.\\nBut what would they do if that feeling?

So you can never predict what people will do about their feelings.\\n\\n>That's no better than flipping a coin.\\n\\nIn terms of knowing if the price is going up or down? No.\\n\\nBut it can indicate for you how strong that movement will be, and you can manage your risk based on that.\\n\\nFrom what I can see, the less than 1% of traders who profit are the ones not with the most success rate, but with the better risk management.\\n\\nBut the best part?\\nHODLING is much easier than that, requires no brain, gives you much more results and less risk than trading. So yeah, Da'hell with trading.\", \"No, people call a support level a line they draw on the chart to try through that line predict the future.\\n\\nThe line can tell you that people find that price cheap, but it can't tell you what people will do next time the price hits that line.

But what would they do if that feeling? No one knows.\\n\\nHow is it useful in trading if it\\'s not actionable (i.e. doesn\\'t yield information about future price direction)? And that\\'s assuming that the market reflects the true sentiment of the whales and is not being manipulated to influence the sentiment of the plebs.\\n\\n>But it can indicate for you how strong that movement will be, and you can manage your risk based on that.\\n\\nCan it though? I have yet to meet an analyst that would consistently be better than chance in their predictions. More often than not, I\\'ve seen people throw around a bunch of bs and then try to sell you an insider TG channel, a trading strategy, mentoring or some other non-market-based revenue stream for the analyst. Their \"market analysis\" is just a marketing scheme for their real business. If someone really had a reliably profitable trading strategy they wouldn\\'t need to sell you stuff. They\\'d just make money off the market and chill.\\n\\nAs for the traders that turn a profit (the 1% you mentioned). If the chance of turning a profit in any given month is 50% then for 1024 traders you get 512 profitable after a month, 256 profitable in 2 consecutive months, 128 profitable in 3 consecutive months, ..., 1 profitable in 10 consecutive months. That \"10 consecutive profitable trading months genius\" should emerge by pure chance alone if there were only 1024 traders and the chance of turning a profit in any given month was a coin toss. That trader would probably have a strategy (most traders do) and would probably think their strategy is brilliant. 😉\\n\\nWhile I agree that hodling is much better, I still disagree that there\\'s any advantage in TA.', 'You don\\'t become the 1% of Traders by having a more than 50% rate of success, the only thing that matters is what you do after being right or wrong.\\n\\nHow do you manage your losing trade?

He is the only trader in Brazil I don\\'t consider a scammer.', \"Have you read Fooled by Randomness by Taleb? It's a very informative book and I highly recommend it.\\n\\nMy point is that markets have a ton of randomness in them and that gains and losses are much more attributable to luck than they are to skill.\\n\\nThere's always going to be a guy who has these incredible results just because there's a lot of traders and through sheer luck one of them is bound to hit a streak. Not saying there's no skill in trading. Just saying that the luck component, which seems to be the most important one, is usually severely underestimated.\", 'Your explanation works in the sort term, not in the long term.

There might have been a dominant miner early on , but might not have either and we have no idea that it was satoshi or not. \\n\\nSatoshi having 1 million BTC is a myth created by sergio which was quickly shown to be flawed and contradictory.\\nHere is Sergio's original post - \\n\\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175996.msg1832533#msg1832533\\n\\nand followup\\n\\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=178629.0\\n\\nWhere Greg and others point out flaws in his research and how some of it is self contradictory \\n\\nHere is Bitmex's follow up research on the matter - \\n\\nhttps://blog.bitmex.com/satoshis-1-million-bitcoin/\\n\\n>In conclusion, although there is strong evidence of a dominant miner in 2009, we think **the evidence is far less robust than many have assumed.** Although a picture is worth a thousand words, sometimes pictures can be a little misleading. Even if one is convinced, the evidence only supports the claim that the **dominant miner may have generated significantly less than a million bitcoin in our view. Perhaps 600,000 to 700,000 bitcoin** is a better estimate.\\n\\n>**None of the above says much about whether the dominant miner was Satoshi**, although we know Satoshi mined block 9, which we have allocated to the dominant miner in our analysis. **However this is in a slope of just 11 blocks, so it’s certainly not conclusive**. Whoever the dominant miner was, it is of course **possible the keys have been lost or discarded by now**.\\n\\n> The analysis is built on a logical fallacy. In any period there is going to be at least one miner who has the largest share or the steepest rate of increase in the ExtraNonce. There are also going to be at least some types slopes which do not overlap. Grouping these slopes from potentially different miners together is misleading and potentially based on flawed reasoning.\\n\\nThus block 9 and genesis block was created by Satoshi 100%, and the evidence reflects he might have mined 11 blocks at least in addition to the genesis under these assumptions .\\n\\nThis means the evidence suggests we definitely know satoshi mined 2 blocks , and likely mined 11 blocks, and that **perhaps** there was a dominant miner who mined between 600-700k bitcoin(not blocks). **There are other explanations for the extranonce pattern that do not point to a dominant miner. Simply a similar software setup can cause this.**\\n\\nSince there was over 5 days between the genesis block being mined and block 1 and difficulty was 1 it would be safer to assume satoshi waited for other miners to start mining before joining in . Satoshi released the code 2 months before launching Bitcoin on multiple popular mailing lists and designed the original client so multiple peers on the network must exist to produce blocks. \\n\\nHere are examples of at least 2 early miners mining alongside satoshi from the start \\n\\nhttps://stephanlivera.com/episode/314/\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/halfin/status/1110302988\", 'other traders usually panic too which is why whales can create bull and bear traps to trick smaller traders', 'I think the main factors which would impact the price would be market liquidity and current demand. We also have to assume around 20% of all BTC is lost and unrecoverable, according to multiple studies. We have seen massive drawdowns of BTC before in a short period of time, and once panic hits in the crypto currency market, it falls fast.', 'Because that’s how order books work. The percentage of the total amount doesn’t mean anything. It only matters what’s on the order book. \\nEven a $1 market sell would move the price to the highest bid. If that highest bid is at -20% (or wherever) then that is where the price moves to, on that exchange at least. \\nThen arbitrage takes over', 'we have no idea \\n\\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1jkcx23/hypothetically_is_it_possible/mjuk8yf/\\n\\nwe can simply make educated guesses that some early people have larger amounts of btc']"

         "Is this true \n\nTo determine how fast you could mine 0.02 bitcoins at a hash rate of 200 GH/s, you need to consider a few factors, including the Bitcoin network's current difficulty level and the block reward.\n### Current Context\n1. **Hash Rate**: 200 GH/s (200 billion hashes per second).\n2. **Bitcoin Block Reward**: As of now, the block reward is 6.25 bitcoins per block (this reward halves approximately every four years, with the next halving expected in 2024).\n3. **Bitcoin Network Difficulty**: This is a measure of how difficult it is to find a new block. The network adjusts the difficulty approximately every two weeks to ensure that a block is mined roughly every 10 minutes.\n### Calculations\n1. **Network Hash Rate**: The total hash rate of the Bitcoin network can influence how long it takes to mine new coins. For this example, let's assume the current network hash rate is around 300 EH/s (300,000,000 GH/s), which is a rough estimate.\n2. **Probability of Finding a Block**: The probability of your mining operation (200 GH/s) finding a block can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Your Hash Rate}}{\\text{Network Hash Rate}} = \\frac{200 \\text{ GH/s}}{300,000,000 \\text{ GH/s}} \\approx 0.0000006667\n   \\]\n3. **Expected Number of Blocks**: Knowing that it takes about 10 minutes to find a block on average, the expected time to find one block is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Time to Find One Block (in minutes)} = \\frac{10 \\text{ minutes}}{0.0000006667} \\approx 15,000,000 \\text{ minutes} \\approx 28.5 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n4. **Mining 0.02 Bitcoin**: Since the block reward is 6.25 bitcoins per block, you would need to mine a portion of a block to get 0.02 bitcoins:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Time to Mine 0.02 Bitcoin} \\approx \\frac{0.02 \\text{ Bitcoin}}{6.25 \\text{ Bitcoin/block}} \\times 15,000,000 \\text{ minutes} \\approx 48,000 \\text{ minutes} \\approx 33.3 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n### Summary\nAt a hash rate of 200 GH/s, it is estimated that you would take approximately **33.3 days** to mine **0.02 bitcoins**, assuming constant network difficulty and no changes in the hash rate. Keep in mind that fluctuations in network difficulty, competition, and mining rewards can significantly impact this estimate.",

         "\"One of the most promising areas of neobanking development is the integration of cryptocurrency services. Today, more and more neobanks are offering their users the opportunity to buy, sell, and use cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions. There are several reasons for this:\n\n– **Demand creates supply.** Every year, the number of cryptocurrency users is growing, and at the same time, more and more people are considering crypto as an alternative to traditional payment solutions. Neobanks are taking advantage of this opportunity and offering relevant services to meet the needs of their customers.\n\n– **Providing faster and cheaper transactions.** One of the advantages of cryptocurrencies is their decentralized nature, which eliminates the need for intermediaries such as traditional banks. As a result, transaction costs and processing speeds are reduced, which contributes to the efficiency of cross-border payments.\n\n– **Transparency and security of the blockchain.** Blockchain technology ensures transparency and high reliability, as each transaction is visible to all network participants and can be verified and confirmed.\n\n– **Portfolio diversification.** Neobanks give users the opportunity to store both fiat and crypto assets, which allows them to diversify their portfolio and manage it through one platform.\"\n\n  \n*Do you think neobanks have a real chance to lead crypto adoption?*\n\n[Full source](https://36crypto.com/neobanks-vs-traditional-banks-whos-winning-the-crypto-race/)",

If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there’s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit.”\\n\\n3) Some believe that Bitcoin‘s 21 million limit was arbitrarily set by Nakamoto when he made two key decisions.

However, without sufficient proof, there's a very real possibility that Satoshi never actually wrote that.\", \"The Bitcoin code doesn't ACTUALLY divide the amount in half.

However, there isn't any explanation in the source code about WHY that particular number was used instead of some other number.\", \"Thats the value that Satoshi chose for the block reward for the first 210,000 blocks before it got cut in half the first time.  Most people think it's 50.0 bitcoins, but in the blockchain and in transactions there aren't actually any decimals. Everything is stored and represented as an integer number of Satoshis. Then the wallet software and block explorer software moves the decimal place over 8 places to show it to us humans.\\n\\nSo, the block reward started at 5,000,000,000 Satoshis. Then it got cut in half to 2,500,000,000 Satoshis, and so on until now it's 312,500,000 Satoshis. \\n\\nSince the values are stored as integers, eventually when cut in half there will be a fraction that will just get thrown away. So, the reward will get cut in half from 9,765,625 Satoshis (0.09765625 BTC) resulting in 4,882,812 Satoshis (notice that it's rounded down to avoid the 0.5 decimal portion).\", 'It appears likely that the starting point of 5 billion units per block and the \"halving\" (actually a bitwise shift on the integer value) were the active decisions.

An analysis was done in 2014 (as of block number 305,303) which found that 135.20897146 BTC of the expected 12,882,575 BTC at that time were missing and would never be replaced.

    "1. Stonk\n",
    "Stonk means stock. The meme was a cheeky reference to making bad financial decisions, sort of like someone who cannot even pronounce stocks correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Diamond Hands\n",
    "The term “diamond hands” refers to holding on to a stock or option despite volatility and losses in the confidence that its price will eventually increase. On memes, the phrase is represented with emojis of a diamond and then hands. The term actually indicates risk taking, and is sometimes the folly of stubbornly holding on to a stock or option until the bitter end, even when the ship should have been abandoned long ago. Whether having diamond hands is good or bad will probably depend on the final outcome of the ticker symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Tendies\n",
    "Tendies is short for chicken tenders. The term moved to r/wallstreetbets where members used it self-deprecatingly in reference to their own living arrangements. Eventually, the term came to be associated with money or profit made from stock trading and options trading, which is how it’s most frequently used today.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. YOLO\n",
    "You only live once. This term actually seems to originate from the notion encapsulated in the Latin “carpe diem” (seize the day). In internet parlance, YOLO often humorously refers to an extremely risky choice that seems simultaneously laughable and dangerous. On Wallstreetbets, YOLO could apply to a trade where an investor puts in the majority of their capital—for instance, putting 95 percent of their account into Dogecoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. HODL\n",
    "HODL might seem to stand for Hold on For Dear Life, the encapsulated notion of which is also popularly expressed in the phrase Hold the Line. But actually, HODL really came about because of a typo for hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "It all started on December 18th in 2013, when user GameKyuubi posted an inebriated, typo-filled, and only partially coherent internet rant about his poor trading skills, and how it would be better for people like himself to avoid day trading and stick to a buy and hold principle. The title of the post was I AM HODLING, and the rest is history. Images from Braveheart, 300, and Game of Thrones have provided the meme substance for promoters of the HODL principle—that is, avoid trading decisions based on short term swings, which can be simply ruinous for stock investors who do not know what they are doing. The HODL principle is particularly discussed in the cryptocurrency venue, where it contrasts against principles such as FOMO (the fear of missing out).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To the Moon\n",
    "As you might guess, this term indicates that a given stock is going to have wild success in terms of its price increase, resulting in a lot of tendies for investors. In emojis, this phrase is indicated by rockets.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see a sizable number of community members using this phrase to discuss a ticker symbol, it might be something you want to pay attention to. Of course, there are certainly other factors as to whether or not that translates to tangible success beyond the reddit threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Apes Together Strong\n",
    "Often represented with a gorilla emoji, the “apes together strong” phrase comes from Planet of the Apes. Apes are retail investors who feel bullish (optimistic) about a particular stock that is expected by short sellers to drop in price. If enough retail investors band together, they can be strong enough to drive up the price of the stock and defeat the goal of the short sellers, who want the price to fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apes together strong encapsulates the idea of the proverbial little man uniting with other everyday people to defeat more powerful institutional investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Bears\n",
    "A bear investor is one who feels bearish about a particular stock (or even the stock market in general). They are somewhat of a debbie downer on the r/wallstreetbets forum, and may become the butt end of jokes and insults, since most community members are looking for that next stock or cryptocurrency to go to the moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tangentially, the phrases bear market and bull market relate to whether the market is going up and down. Since bears strike by coming down on their target, a bear market suggests decreasing stock prices. Because bulls gore their target by moving their horns upward, a bull market suggests increasing prices.\n",

    "9. Buy High Sell Low\n",
    "This is a joke about losses, expressed in a joking reference to the traditional, sensible, and simple advice of buy low and sell high. Someone who bought high and sold low has failed miserably at turning a particular trade into something financially profitable, leaving them at the mercy of jabs from other community members.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Buy the Dip\n",
    "For members who feel overall bullish about a particular stop, slight dips in its generally upward price are a momentary respite to buy the stock at a discount. Buying the dip expresses this timely trade, and is often paired with Diamond Hands and To the Moon for a potent meme trio.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Paper Hands\n",
    "Paper hands are the opposite of diamond hands, referencing traders who unload their shares at the first sign of bad news. As you can imagine, the connotation here is somewhat negative in its indication of a trader who acts too quickly, out of fear.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. We Like the Stock\n",
    "This phrase comes from Jim Cramer, who was the host of Mad Money on CNBC. The simple phrase is used to indicate a favorable attitude toward holding a stock, much in the same way that Cramer would have used the phrase. \n",

         "A long time ago I had got myself some BTC in a Samourai wallet and after not looking at it for a while found that it was completely empty with 0 transaction history. I didn't look into it at all and naively figured I had been hacked or something. Only now, years later have I decided to look into it and discovered that FBI business and the hopeful fact that my money could still be out there.\n\nI've been trying to recover it first via Sparrow and now Blue wallet on my phone, both to no avail.\n\nI've tried exporting the backup txt file from Samourai and importing that into Sparrow with all different script types, no dice.\n\nI've tried the 12 word mnemonic and passphrase with Sparrow telling me it could not find a wallet with existing transactions. Blue wallet was able to find a wallet with those 12 words but same result as every other attempt, empty wallet with no transaction history whatsoever.\n\nI'm wondering what to do in this scenario as a complete beginner who knows literally nothing and understands less.\n\nAlso, what are the odds that my money is actually just gone?\n\nThank you\n\nDon't DM me ",

That is already valuable for millions today, not just speculators.\\n\\nProof of work, global miner distribution, and a hard-coded supply cap are not gimmicks. They solve real problems in the current system. CBDCs will not offer any of that. They will be programmable control systems, not money.\\n\\nWill there be volatility? Of course. Is it speculative? Sure. But the internet was full of hype too. That did not mean the underlying protocol did not change everything.\\n\\nBitcoin is open source monetary infrastructure.

And when people sell its done.\\n\\nBut why is a math question with a specific answer in binary worth ≈$87k. Because that is what it is, or it has a number of 0 and then a 1. And you cant do what is something that becomes 5? 4+1, root25, 10-5, etc.\\n\\nYou have to have a computer make a random mathecuation, run it and then if the answer is correct you get a bitcoin.\\n\\nI dont understand the value.'\n 'Non-conformity currency. \\n\\nIts intrinsic value is its ability to be used unbiased, unrestricted, and individualized.\\n\\nIts intrinsic value is also its decentralization, before I get rattled on about how that’s not an intrinsic value, let me explain… \\n\\nDecentralization is more than just not relying on a single entity, but a collection of entities, it doesn’t conform to a corporation, government, or even a culture. That collection of entities has control over its extrinsic value, which in turn gives it intrinsic value, it is by design, going to succeed because as time progresses humanity becomes more rational, with rationality comes more desire for decentralization because of individual judgement. Of course this assumes we will become more rational however'\n 'Why is any money worth anything?'\n 'Seems like you have a pretty solid understanding of the situation to me.'\n 'It’s harder to understand if you’re in a first world country.  \\n\\nPeople that have experienced quadruple digit inflation, bank freezes etc understand it quite well.  \\n\\nWhen you realize your dollar bills are just physical manifestations of shitcoins it all comes together.'\n 'If someone sold e-gold, that could become a thing.

In other words it's grounded in the real world making it impossible to duplicate, double spend or debase it \\n\\nIn short it's the rarest thing in the universe that we know of.\"\n \"At a certain point, a massive sell-off just doesn't make sense for the owners. If you hold a large amount of stocks or real estate, you wouldn’t want the value of your equity to drop, so instead of dumping it on the market, you’d do everything possible to pump up its price. Just look at the stock and real estate markets over the past 100 years. Many stocks are arguably overvalued if you go by PE ratios, but the wealthy own a lot of them, so it’s only logical that they’d try to inflate the value and build systems that strongly incentivize the general public to buy in. Imagine if China and the US each held 30% of all Bitcoin or its mining power, it just wouldn’t make sense for them to crash the market.\"\n \"You really need it explained to you?

         "I came across a quote recently that really resonated with me: \"Whatever you lose, you’ll find it again. But what you throw away you’ll never get back.\" - Kenshin Himura\n\nIn the world of Bitcoin, this couldn't be more relevant. Many of us have experienced the rollercoaster of emotions that comes with the market's volatility. We've seen our investments dip and rise, and some of us have even panicked and sold at a loss. But here's the thing: while we might lose some value temporarily, the potential for recovery is always there.\r\r\n\nWhen we hold onto our Bitcoin, we’re not just holding a digital asset; we’re holding onto a vision of the future—a future where financial freedom and decentralization are the norms. Every time we choose to hold rather than sell, we’re betting on that future.\r\r\n\nOn the flip side, think about those who have thrown away their Bitcoin—whether it was due to fear, impatience, or misunderstanding. Those coins are gone forever, and with them, the opportunity to be part of something revolutionary.\r\rSo, let’s remind ourselves: in this journey, it’s okay to feel the fear of loss, but let’s not throw away our potential. The market will fluctuate, but our belief in Bitcoin’s value should remain steadfast.",

(Fun Fact: \"Salary\" comes from *sal*, which is Latin for salt.) For example, beads were used as a medium of barter within and among communities in Africa. For the natives, the beads were hard money since they were difficult to make, keeping their supply-to-stock ratio in check. They met the three most important criteria for money: **saleability across time, space, and scale**.\\n\\n* **Time:** The beads didn\\'t lose value or deteriorate.\\n* **Space:** They were easy to transport due to their lightweight nature.\\n* **Scale:** They were easily divisible.\\n\\nHowever, they only retained their value while their supply remained scarce. When Europeans started mass-manufacturing the beads and using them to buy African resources cheaply, the supply rapidly increased, causing their value to collapse. The same trade beads, once considered valuable, were later used as \"slave beads\" in the transatlantic slave trade—a very sad story with an important lesson about the stock-to-flow ratio and hardness of money'\n 'Because you wrote words that come to my mind, but I could not write them down as you did, anyway, support exploration and analysis, and thank you🙏'\n 'No idea who that is.

         "Hey everyone, l've been thinking about Bitcoin lately. There's something like 70 million millionaires in the world now, which is wild to me. So what if just a small chunk of them, maybe 5 to 10 percent, so around 3.5 to 7 million people, decided to buy at least 1 BTC each? I'm curious why we don't see this happening more often. Are they scared off by the volatility, or do they just not understand btc or crypto in general? I mean, if Bitcoin's sitting around $88k or so, that's pocket change for some of them, right?\n\nThen there's the supply question that's been bugging me. Bitcoin's capped at 21 million coins total, and most of that's already mined, but l've read a bunch are lost forever, like from old wallets people can't access. So if millions of millionaires jumped in to grab a coin each, would there be enough Bitcoin left? Or would the price just shoot through the roof because there's not enough to meet the demand? I'm not a finance guru or anything, just someone who likes pondering this stuff.",

         "So recently, I decided to invest in the crypto market using the principles from Benjamin Graham’s book The Intelligent Investor. If you don’t know, Graham is known as the father of value investing. The book was first published in 1949, gets revised every decade or so, and has been praised by Warren Buffett (arguably the greatest inventor of all time), who called it \"by far the best book about investing ever written.\"\n\nFor context, Buffett started with just $20K at 21 and turned that into $109B by 92, all by following these principles.\n\nAfter reading the book, I decided all in on the RWA (Real-World Asset) sector on 5 specific coins I considered to follow the book’s principles the most and was surprised at how little my portfolio dropped over the last two months, especially compared to the rest of the market. Tonight, I got curious and asked ChatGPT:\n\n\"If Benjamin Graham invested in crypto today (March 26, 2025), what would his portfolio look like?\"\n\nTo my surprise, every coin I picked was on the list. Not gonna name them so I don’t sound like I’m shilling.\n\nIt really made me wonder what the crypto market would look like if more retail investors actually followed value investing principles instead of gambling on meme coins and chasing XRP hopium.\n\nMight be worth checking out The Intelligent Investor if you’re new to investing and or wanna do better in crypto market. \n\nTBH i don’t know if following these principles will work in crypto in the long run, with the market being so volatile, all and filled with so many investors who don’t really understand how to invest (I want to say investors even though they’re all treating it like gambling!) and overall different environment, but it might just push the crypto market enough to start brining in some serious institutional investors. \n\nAlso if you want to know what the key principles are in the book, just google or ChatGPT it, I don’t wanna make this post too long.",

Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum has a strong use case in supporting decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. With the Ethereum network undergoing significant upgrades (such as Ethereum 2.0), it could be seen as a blockchain with long-term growth potential. Binance Coin (BNB): Binance Coin is the native token of the Binance exchange, which is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Its utility and growth potential, coupled with the success of Binance as a platform, might appeal to Graham as it has established itself as a significant player in the ecosystem. Cardano (ADA): Known for its research-driven approach and focus on scalability and sustainability, Cardano could be seen as a blockchain project with a strong technological foundation. Graham might appreciate its focus on security, peer-reviewed research, and academic rigor. Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink provides decentralized oracles, which are essential for connecting smart contracts with real-world data. With its unique niche in the crypto space, Graham could view Chainlink as an essential infrastructure play with real-world utility and long-term value. Graham would likely avoid highly speculative or „pump and dump“ coins and instead focus on those that show solid use cases, adoption, and the potential for growth based on fundamentals.'\n \"BNB? ADA? \\n\\nThis is why LLM's shouldn't be used.\"\n 'Rather than this pointless statement, make an argument against these.'\n 'BNB is a copy and paste EVM chain. It is centralised and majority controlled by chinese validators. \\n\\nBanks and RWA issuers will not be trusting their value to Binance. \\n\\nADA is best explained by; \\nhttps://defillama.com/chain/Cardano\\n\\nIt has minimal stable liquidity, minimal users, minimal apps. Ghost chain. \\n\\nI stupidly assumed users of a subreddit called Cryptomarkets would be well aware why they are terrrible suggestions.'\n \"Binance has done $16.8b in revenue. Growing like 30% from last year. Binance is the king crypto exchange. They are the web 3 bank. I have made bank on BNB over the years and I don't think it's growth is done. I disagree with alot of it's practices, but it just works..\\n\\nCharles Hoskinson is a shitty brand ambassador, I hold some ADA from years ago but don't expect magic.\"\n 'Its value is irrelevant. The US will be leading the tokenisation of assets (due to be the only country with a legal framework). And binance is chinese run, and already under fire from previous adminstrations so unlikely to get a suitable license/approval/whatever to be used by US banks. \\n\\nhttps://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution \\n\\nYou making money on it is not a argument in its favour. In this circumstance.\\n\\nIf Charles knew what he was doing, he would be encouraging devs into Cardano, paying for a USDC or CCIP integration. Instead he is basking in his strange cult following while his chain languishes and slowly fails.']",

They aren’t based in the USA, and are theoretically not vulnerable to the sanctions regime or intel-gathering that are part and parcel of transacting in USD. They also are a smoother interface with exchanges, allowing for 24/7 transactions and easy movement between accounts. \\n\\nThe new ones are rising out of increasing US government interest in stablecoins. They come with the key advantage of being regulated and thus significantly more accountable to holders. It’s a lot easier for sketchy, ever-relocating Tether to rob you than for Fidelity to do the same. They have a lot of the same advantages with regard to smoothing the friction between exchanges and USD, and eliminating trading hours. But they don’t facilitate use of USD for people concerned about sanctions and intelligence gathering, either, because of the government oversight. They’re much more integrated into the global dollar system.'\n 'No need to burn real money. Burn book money.'\n 'Why would it be inflationary? Taking the money in to create the stable coin is as deflationary as the creation of the token is inflationary. Add to that the new foreign demand for easily accessible dollars and it’s deflationary.'\n 'Inflation is affected if they print real USD. Stablecoins (assuming they are real and purposeful, not a scam) is not an act of printing more USD, but rather wrapping existing USD (or treasury bonds which also works) and issuing the USD value on-chain. \\n\\nThe one interesting phenomena which is already a thing but obviously going to be even more frequent, is the algorithmic stablecoins that are typically based off on-chain debt. That would push your circulating supply of stables to be > total amount of physical USD backing but then the debt those projects need to back the stables (and keep the peg) balances out that additional supply.\\n\\nOne of the good thing about on-chain stables is that crypto markets have no problem de-pegging a stable very quickly if there is suspicion of devaluing.'\n 'This is the answer.

That said, in an over-saturated market like we already have, creating new (and largely unnecesary) reserves of USD on-chain will create more inflation. This is especially true if the US government does it.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nBy taking money out of the general economy and switching it online, you are still essentially creating more dollars. If the business (for example tether or ethena) should fail, the stablecoins will still exist even if the USD is removed from their reserves. Naturally, Tether is unlikely to fail (god forbid we wind up with the crypto version of too big to fail), but others will (see Terra Luna collapse, even though that was not a traditional stablecoin).

By creating stables we are removing it from the \"real\" world and issuing it on-chain instead.\\n\\nWhat I think you might be referring to is the effect it will have... which is crypto prices soaring (which you can call inflation if you will) due to a heavy influx of liquidity (stablecoins) entering crypto markets.'\n 'bruhh just go back to playing video games otherwise watch a video on makerDAO and educate yourself on DAI. Based on your lack of understanding, explaining this concept in a message would be like attempting to teach a monkey basic math.'\n 'money laundering.'\n 'For the same reason banks have their own internal systems. They also cannot get rid of these legacy systems even if they want to adopt blockchain tech. Banks want to keep these systems and plug them into blockchain. \\n\\n[https://www.swift.com/news-events/news/swift-explores-blockchain-interoperability-remove-friction-tokenised-asset-settlement](https://www.swift.com/news-events/news/swift-explores-blockchain-interoperability-remove-friction-tokenised-asset-settlement)\\n\\n\"There’s unlikely to be a single prevailing blockchain network,” said Tom Zschach, Chief Innovation Officer at Swift. “We would expect to see a multitude of different platforms emerging, each serving different customer segments with their own bespoke capabilities and requirements.\"\\n\\n\"Our experiments will help advance the industry’s understanding about the technical and business requirements involved when interacting with and between multiple blockchain networks,” Ehrenfeld added. “They will also highlight the potential value of using a blockchain interoperability protocol to securely transfer data and value between legacy systems and a potentially unlimited number of blockchains.”'\n \"Not quite, though I am also concerned about the greater crypto market. Right now things look good for stable coins, because the US government is in favor of it. Should they change their minds or have a change of administration, they will be inclined to retrieve all of these reserve dollars by printing new ones. If they are pegged on-chain they don't 'exist' within the wider economy, therefore if 100 projects have X billion dollars stored to back their on-chain counterparts, then the government will have to do something to bring them back into circulation. This is one of many hypithetical ways it can increase inflation and of course is speculative. I respect your opinion, of course and believe I may be wrong, but this is a concern I have for the spike in new stable coins.\\n\\nUltimately it comes down to... what are they for? Why do we need so many different ones?\"\n '>\\xa0Banks want to keep these systems and plug them into blockchain.\\n\\nWhy would they incur more costs to run their blockchains? If they do it as an L2, they need to pay for data availability. If they do it as an L1, they need to launch a token with inflation to pay for validators.\\n\\nIt makes no sense to adopt a system that costs them more money. They can just plug their centralized server into any chain and piggyback off the costs paid by said chain\\'s token holders.\\n\\nRight now, the only ones hyping these bank-specialized chains are VC products struggling to get enough interest in their token to justify their currently high valuations. They are doing it in the hope that their tokens will get an \"L1 premium\" - not really utility based.'\n \"you make a valid point. I think at this time everything is speculation. I am also confused as to why is everyone jumping on this now. Stablecoins aren't new, and why would I start using something other than USDC? (Tether was always sketchy, but also the one known scam that never actually scammed).\\n\\nA theory I have is that regulations will allow institutional players (banks, visa, etc.) to utilize authorized stables in regular non-crypto transactions. I doubt this means we will get immediate POS stable transactions, but it may mean these legacy institutions will have dedicated portals to move stables between legacy financial systems on on-chain. So now the motivation is for each player to have their own stable so they can maximize fees.\\n\\nYour theory with future administrations however is also valid. Crypto has to continue with its boom and bust cycles some how, so a new democrat government that tries to thwart any infra put in place now definitely could happen and will likely be a bear catalyst.\"\n 'Because banks will never give full control over to a public chain?

         "\"What Technical Analysis Isn’t vs. What It Actually Is",
         "Normally, when people see someone drawing lines on a chart, they get intrigued. But scammers have become so prevalent in the world of \"technical analysis\" that many no longer believe in it.\n\nSo, I decided to explain what TA actually is—and what it isn’t.\n\nWhat TA isn’t:\n\nTA is not a tool for \"predicting the future.\" There is no rule in the world that says, \"If the price hits this support level, it must go up.\" In reality, the price will respect that level about 50% of the time—and the other 50% of the time, it won’t. The market doesn’t care about the lines on your screen.\n\n\nWhat TA is:\n\nTA is about using these lines not to predict the future, but to gather information.\n\n\nIf Bitcoin has historically dropped to $78K-$80K before bouncing back, does that mean $78K-$80K is a \"SuPpOrT LeVeL™\"? No. It simply means that most traders—or more importantly, the traders with the most money—look at Bitcoin at that price and think, \"Nice, that's a price I’m willing to pay.\"\n\nThis tells you that historically, $78K-$80K has been a good entry point, because buyers have seen Bitcoin as cheap at those levels and were willing to buy.\n\nBut that’s true for now. What if, tomorrow, a new pandemic starts? People will have less disposable income and may be forced to sell their BTC holdings. If that happens, the price will likely drop below $78K.\n\nAt that point, you'll need to adjust your TA because people will no longer see Bitcoin at $78K as cheap. Due to external factors, $78K could suddenly become expensive, and now most buyers might only be interested at, say, $50K.\n\nSo, TA is basically a tool to understand how the market feels about Bitcoin’s price at any given time. But since we’re dealing with human beings, and human emotions can change for all sorts of reasons, TA will never be perfect. That’s why you shouldn’t get too caught up in drawing random lines on a chart—they only tell you what’s happening now, not what will happen in the future.\n\nOf course, if you know that what’s happening now will continue into the future, you can make some predictions.\n\nFor example:\n\nWe know that governments will continue printing money, because politicians don’t care about their people—they only care about their wallets. Since Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million, while fiat money keeps inflating, Bitcoin’s price will increase in the long run.\n\nWe also know that the Bitcoin halving will continue to occur every four years. This means Bitcoin’s supply will keep decreasing, which historically leads to price appreciation.\n\n\nHowever, you can never predict the exact timing of the market in the short to medium term. So instead of trading and losing money—like 100% of traders who aren’t selling online courses on how to “get rich trading”—just Buy and HODL Bitcoin for at least four years (ideally for life) and make money like 100% of long-term HODLers.\n\nTL;DR: TA is useful, but HODL is better.",

That\\'s no better than flipping a coin. You also seem to be aware that external factors could sway the market either way at any given point in time. You claim that it gives you additional info, but also note that it\\'s not a tool that can reliably predict the future in any meaningful way.\\n\\nOn top of it all, there are multiple traders, each looking at different \"patterns\" on different time scales and supporting their claims with different supporting indicators. Some of them are bound to \"be right\" just because there\\'s so many of them and because all possible angles are covered. One of them is bound to \"predict\" it correctly. Moreover, a lot of the traders make both bull and bear cases in the same video based on the same data.\\n\\nHow is TA useful, then? It\\'s basically saying \"I have no idea what\\'s coming next\", but with a ton of extra steps. To quote you: \"The market doesn’t care about the lines on your screen.\"'\n '>It simply means that most traders—or more importantly, the traders with the most money—look at Bitcoin at that price and think, \"Nice, that\\'s a price I’m willing to pay.\"\\n\\n\\nAKA support level'\n 'Do you have at least 5 years of trading and at least 1000 trades to test if you have more than 50% success rate?\\n\\nIf you flip a coin 10 times you can get 10 tails, but if you flip it 1000 times you will get closer to 500/500.'\n 'Also, a computer can recognize these patterns a million times faster if there was profit in it.'\n \"It's useful to know what most people (or people with the most money) in the market are feeling right now.\\nBut what would they do if that feeling? No one knows.\\n\\nSome people during a big crash feel desperate and give up. Others look at that as a challenge and go all in. So you can never predict what people will do about their feelings.\\n\\n>That's no better than flipping a coin.\\n\\nIn terms of knowing if the price is going up or down? No.\\n\\nBut it can indicate for you how strong that movement will be, and you can manage your risk based on that.\\n\\nFrom what I can see, the less than 1% of traders who profit are the ones not with the most success rate, but with the better risk management.\\n\\nBut the best part?\\nHODLING is much easier than that, requires no brain, gives you much more results and less risk than trading. So yeah, Da'hell with trading.\"\n \"No, people call a support level a line they draw on the chart to try through that line predict the future.\\n\\nThe line can tell you that people find that price cheap, but it can't tell you what people will do next time the price hits that line. You can only know what is happening, not what is going to happen. There is no rule in the universe that says price must do X because you draw a line on the chart.\"\n '>It\\'s useful to know what most people (or people with the most money) in the market are feeling right now. But what would they do if that feeling? No one knows.\\n\\nHow is it useful in trading if it\\'s not actionable (i.e. doesn\\'t yield information about future price direction)? And that\\'s assuming that the market reflects the true sentiment of the whales and is not being manipulated to influence the sentiment of the plebs.\\n\\n>But it can indicate for you how strong that movement will be, and you can manage your risk based on that.\\n\\nCan it though? I have yet to meet an analyst that would consistently be better than chance in their predictions. More often than not, I\\'ve seen people throw around a bunch of bs and then try to sell you an insider TG channel, a trading strategy, mentoring or some other non-market-based revenue stream for the analyst. Their \"market analysis\" is just a marketing scheme for their real business. If someone really had a reliably profitable trading strategy they wouldn\\'t need to sell you stuff. They\\'d just make money off the market and chill.\\n\\nAs for the traders that turn a profit (the 1% you mentioned). If the chance of turning a profit in any given month is 50% then for 1024 traders you get 512 profitable after a month, 256 profitable in 2 consecutive months, 128 profitable in 3 consecutive months, ..., 1 profitable in 10 consecutive months. That \"10 consecutive profitable trading months genius\" should emerge by pure chance alone if there were only 1024 traders and the chance of turning a profit in any given month was a coin toss. That trader would probably have a strategy (most traders do) and would probably think their strategy is brilliant. 😉\\n\\nWhile I agree that hodling is much better, I still disagree that there\\'s any advantage in TA.'\n 'You don\\'t become the 1% of Traders by having a more than 50% rate of success, the only thing that matters is what you do after being right or wrong.\\n\\nHow do you manage your losing trade? When do you take profit? That\\'s how you get to the top 1%.\\n\\nIf you wanna look at a public example of that go to the website \"myfxbook\" and search for \"ever investor\", is a trader from my country (Brazil) that has lots of public trading accounts, where you can see how much he deposit or withdraw from them, and how positive or negative he is in all of them.\\n\\nHe\\'s so good at it that que was hired from the Bank of Brazil.\\n\\nHe is the only guy I saw on the entire internet that does that. He is the only trader in Brazil I don\\'t consider a scammer.'\n \"Have you read Fooled by Randomness by Taleb? It's a very informative book and I highly recommend it.\\n\\nMy point is that markets have a ton of randomness in them and that gains and losses are much more attributable to luck than they are to skill.\\n\\nThere's always going to be a guy who has these incredible results just because there's a lot of traders and through sheer luck one of them is bound to hit a streak. Not saying there's no skill in trading. Just saying that the luck component, which seems to be the most important one, is usually severely underestimated.\"\n 'Your explanation works in the sort term, not in the long term.

There might have been a dominant miner early on , but might not have either and we have no idea that it was satoshi or not. \\n\\nSatoshi having 1 million BTC is a myth created by sergio which was quickly shown to be flawed and contradictory.\\nHere is Sergio's original post - \\n\\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175996.msg1832533#msg1832533\\n\\nand followup\\n\\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=178629.0\\n\\nWhere Greg and others point out flaws in his research and how some of it is self contradictory \\n\\nHere is Bitmex's follow up research on the matter - \\n\\nhttps://blog.bitmex.com/satoshis-1-million-bitcoin/\\n\\n>In conclusion, although there is strong evidence of a dominant miner in 2009, we think **the evidence is far less robust than many have assumed.** Although a picture is worth a thousand words, sometimes pictures can be a little misleading. Even if one is convinced, the evidence only supports the claim that the **dominant miner may have generated significantly less than a million bitcoin in our view. Perhaps 600,000 to 700,000 bitcoin** is a better estimate.\\n\\n>**None of the above says much about whether the dominant miner was Satoshi**, although we know Satoshi mined block 9, which we have allocated to the dominant miner in our analysis. **However this is in a slope of just 11 blocks, so it’s certainly not conclusive**. Whoever the dominant miner was, it is of course **possible the keys have been lost or discarded by now**.\\n\\n> The analysis is built on a logical fallacy. In any period there is going to be at least one miner who has the largest share or the steepest rate of increase in the ExtraNonce. There are also going to be at least some types slopes which do not overlap. Grouping these slopes from potentially different miners together is misleading and potentially based on flawed reasoning.\\n\\nThus block 9 and genesis block was created by Satoshi 100%, and the evidence reflects he might have mined 11 blocks at least in addition to the genesis under these assumptions .\\n\\nThis means the evidence suggests we definitely know satoshi mined 2 blocks , and likely mined 11 blocks, and that **perhaps** there was a dominant miner who mined between 600-700k bitcoin(not blocks). **There are other explanations for the extranonce pattern that do not point to a dominant miner. Simply a similar software setup can cause this.**\\n\\nSince there was over 5 days between the genesis block being mined and block 1 and difficulty was 1 it would be safer to assume satoshi waited for other miners to start mining before joining in . Satoshi released the code 2 months before launching Bitcoin on multiple popular mailing lists and designed the original client so multiple peers on the network must exist to produce blocks. \\n\\nHere are examples of at least 2 early miners mining alongside satoshi from the start \\n\\nhttps://stephanlivera.com/episode/314/\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/halfin/status/1110302988\"\n 'other traders usually panic too which is why whales can create bull and bear traps to trick smaller traders'\n 'I think the main factors which would impact the price would be market liquidity and current demand. We also have to assume around 20% of all BTC is lost and unrecoverable, according to multiple studies. We have seen massive drawdowns of BTC before in a short period of time, and once panic hits in the crypto currency market, it falls fast.'\n 'Because that’s how order books work. The percentage of the total amount doesn’t mean anything. It only matters what’s on the order book. \\nEven a $1 market sell would move the price to the highest bid. If that highest bid is at -20% (or wherever) then that is where the price moves to, on that exchange at least. \\nThen arbitrage takes over'\n 'we have no idea \\n\\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinBeginners/comments/1jkcx23/hypothetically_is_it_possible/mjuk8yf/\\n\\nwe can simply make educated guesses that some early people have larger amounts of btc']",

         "Is this true \n\nTo determine how fast you could mine 0.02 bitcoins at a hash rate of 200 GH/s, you need to consider a few factors, including the Bitcoin network's current difficulty level and the block reward.\n### Current Context\n1. **Hash Rate**: 200 GH/s (200 billion hashes per second).\n2. **Bitcoin Block Reward**: As of now, the block reward is 6.25 bitcoins per block (this reward halves approximately every four years, with the next halving expected in 2024).\n3. **Bitcoin Network Difficulty**: This is a measure of how difficult it is to find a new block. The network adjusts the difficulty approximately every two weeks to ensure that a block is mined roughly every 10 minutes.\n### Calculations\n1. **Network Hash Rate**: The total hash rate of the Bitcoin network can influence how long it takes to mine new coins. For this example, let's assume the current network hash rate is around 300 EH/s (300,000,000 GH/s), which is a rough estimate.\n2. **Probability of Finding a Block**: The probability of your mining operation (200 GH/s) finding a block can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Your Hash Rate}}{\\text{Network Hash Rate}} = \\frac{200 \\text{ GH/s}}{300,000,000 \\text{ GH/s}} \\approx 0.0000006667\n   \\]\n3. **Expected Number of Blocks**: Knowing that it takes about 10 minutes to find a block on average, the expected time to find one block is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Time to Find One Block (in minutes)} = \\frac{10 \\text{ minutes}}{0.0000006667} \\approx 15,000,000 \\text{ minutes} \\approx 28.5 \\text{ years}\n   \\]\n4. **Mining 0.02 Bitcoin**: Since the block reward is 6.25 bitcoins per block, you would need to mine a portion of a block to get 0.02 bitcoins:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Expected Time to Mine 0.02 Bitcoin} \\approx \\frac{0.02 \\text{ Bitcoin}}{6.25 \\text{ Bitcoin/block}} \\times 15,000,000 \\text{ minutes} \\approx 48,000 \\text{ minutes} \\approx 33.3 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n### Summary\nAt a hash rate of 200 GH/s, it is estimated that you would take approximately **33.3 days** to mine **0.02 bitcoins**, assuming constant network difficulty and no changes in the hash rate. Keep in mind that fluctuations in network difficulty, competition, and mining rewards can significantly impact this estimate.",

If thats a sustained downturn it can have a snowball effect.  It's basically one big feedback look; issue debt/equity to buy Bitcoin, boost Bitcoin price, increase share price, repeat.  It depends on inflows of capital and Bitcoin rising- if either slow significantly or reverse the strategy starts to falter.

         "\"One of the most promising areas of neobanking development is the integration of cryptocurrency services. Today, more and more neobanks are offering their users the opportunity to buy, sell, and use cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions. There are several reasons for this:\n\n– **Demand creates supply.** Every year, the number of cryptocurrency users is growing, and at the same time, more and more people are considering crypto as an alternative to traditional payment solutions. Neobanks are taking advantage of this opportunity and offering relevant services to meet the needs of their customers.\n\n– **Providing faster and cheaper transactions.** One of the advantages of cryptocurrencies is their decentralized nature, which eliminates the need for intermediaries such as traditional banks. As a result, transaction costs and processing speeds are reduced, which contributes to the efficiency of cross-border payments.\n\n– **Transparency and security of the blockchain.** Blockchain technology ensures transparency and high reliability, as each transaction is visible to all network participants and can be verified and confirmed.\n\n– **Portfolio diversification.** Neobanks give users the opportunity to store both fiat and crypto assets, which allows them to diversify their portfolio and manage it through one platform.\"\n\n  \n*Do you think neobanks have a real chance to lead crypto adoption?*\n\n[Full source](https://36crypto.com/neobanks-vs-traditional-banks-whos-winning-the-crypto-race/)",

Such as mimicking the declining marginal output of gold over time, and making decisions to keep the network rules simple and predictable to increase understanding.'\n 'Some educated guesses why satoshi chose 21 million with a halving every 4 years-\\n\\n1) One theory is that at the time of Satoshi’s decision to use 21 million as the finite number of Bitcoin, the global M1 money supply stood at approximately $21 trillion. In economics, this is the global money supply that includes physical currency and coins, demand deposits, traveler\\'s checks, other checkable deposits\\n\\n2) “I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies, but without knowing the future, that’s very hard. I ended up picking something in the middle,” Nakamoto said. “If Bitcoin remains a small niche,” he added, “it’ll be worth less per unit than existing currencies. If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there’s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit.”\\n\\n3) Some believe that Bitcoin‘s 21 million limit was arbitrarily set by Nakamoto when he made two key decisions. That Bitcoin should add new blocks to its blockchain every 10 minutes (on average) and that the reward paid to miners halves every 210,000 blocks – roughly every 4 years.\\n\\n4) \"A total of 174,100 tonnes of gold have been mined in human history, according to GFMS as of 2012.2 This is roughly equivalent to 5.6 billion troy ounces or, in terms of volume, about 9261 m3, or a cube 21.0 m on a side.\"\\n\\n5) 50x210,000(1+1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16....) or\\n\\n50*210,000(2) = 21,000,000 is a nice clean equation to code and mathematically concise\\n\\nCycle 1 = 50 BTC a block, will be 50% of all BTC mined.\\n\\nCycle 2 = 25 BTC a block, will be 25% of all BTC mined.\\n\\nCycle 3 = 12.5 BTC a block, will be 12.5% of all BTC mined.\\n\\nCycle 4 = 6.25 BTC a block, will be 6.25% of all BTC mined.\\n\\nCycle 5 = 3.125 BTC a block, will be 3.125 % of all BTC mined. <--- we are here\\n\\n6) It helps avoid errors on most computer systems, and, is likely sufficient for all possible transactions everywhere.\\n\\nhttps://medium.com/@cseberino/why-21-million-bitcoins-was-a-great-idea-bd2533af0f63\\n\\n7)\\t42 is the answer to the ultimate question about life and meaning and bitcoin is half this\\n\\n\\n\\n8) 21 million as Bitcoin is money for the 21st century.'\n 'Bitcoin is the epitome of when old men plant trees that they will never sit in the shade of.'\n 'Below is a quote from an email that Satoshi sent to Mike Hearn on 12 April 2009.\\n\\n\"My choice for the number of coins and distribution schedule was an educated guess.

If you imagine it being used for some fraction of world commerce, then there\\'s only going to be 21 million coins for the whole world, so it would be worth much more per unit. Values are 64-bit integers with 8 decimal places, so 1 coin is represented internally as 100000000. There\\'s plenty of granularity if typical prices become small. For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 Euro, then it might be easier to change where the decimal point is displayed, so if you had 1 Bitcoin it\\'s now displayed as 1000, and 0.001 is displayed as 1.\"'\n \"32 halvings means that when it's done splitting everyone alive when it was created will be long dead\"\n 'Yu can cut something in half forever, so Satoshi had to \"snip\" the epochs off at a nice round number somewhere...\\n\\n32 makes it so it was so close to 21M that it stuck out I guess. Plus it give the world over a century to monetize it, and Satoshi obviously knew how long monetization takes.'\n 'He didn\\'t \"choose\" 32 halvings. That\\'s just what happens when you take the integer number 5,000,000,000 and cut it in half throwing away any decimal part each time. After 32 halvings, all that\\'s left is zero.'\n '21 is 3 times 7 = 777 lucky'\n \"This is something I've been thinking about for a few months, as well. I don't have any good answers, but the research I did do on the decimal points portion, floating point accuracy tends to decrease below 100% at about ~7-8 decimal places in a 32bit context. Talking out of my ass here, it would make sense to limit things here to increase fidelity.\"\n 'I believe in recently made public (by Adam Back) emails, Satoshi explained why 21 million coins.\\n\\nMost, possibly all of the others have been already addressed on Bitcoin Talk Forum and repeated here.'\n '8 decimal points - ensures BTC can be used for micro transactions \\n32 halvings - every 210K blocks to ensure new BTC issuance asymptomatically approaches zero \\n210K blocks per halving - tied to 4 year cycle, assuming 10 min block time\\nTarget 1 block / 10 min - balance between tx confirm time and network stability scalability \\nStepwise 50% decrease instead of linear - exponential decay models scarcity better and mirrors natural resource depletion patterns \\nMining difficulty adjustment every 2016 blocks - ensures BTC is stable and secure by adjusting to hash rates roughly every two weeks \\n21 million / 210000 = 0.1 Satoshi'\n \"Why 21M?

Other values were re-used/derived/extended by Satoshi from prior works that he built on (remember: Satoshi really only added the self-adjusting difficulty, pretty much every other component was part of some published work of other computer scientists).\\n\\nOther is more or less just programming and maths common sense. 21 million with 8 decimals is near the 64 bit (double) floating point precision. The 8 decimals figure (iirc) he chose because he wanted enough divisibility but not too much. There were emails or testimonies discussing that.\\n\\nEdit, here you go: \\n\\nhttps://medium.com/@Fiach_dubh/1-99-billion-bitcoin-not-21-million-fad9f5550659\"\n 'Thanks! So you refer to what we call today the stock to flow ratio. While I agree that that declines over time, this does not explain why he decided to cut it in half on every halving, instead of for example programming a linear decline on every block until supply was totally mined. \\n\\nI wonder whether Satoshi could have thought about networks which adoption tend to follow a power curve and not an exponential one, and tried to mimic that on the supply issuance curve...'\n 'Thank you!

If Satoshi thinks of full bitcoins as \"units\", that would mean that he expected the total market cap of Bitcoin to sit around $21M, which does not make sense at all.

This was quite revealing! \"The maximum integer that can represented with 51 bits is just slightly over 2100 trillion\"'\n 'For Mr. Satoshi'\n \"I struggle with this quote, for me is to some extent contradictory: \\n\\n>I wanted to pick something that would make prices similar to existing currencies\\n\\nHe doesn't say whether he expect the unit of account to be a full bitcoin or a sat: \\n\\n* In the former, that would imply that the market cap of Bitcoin is $21M, which makes the network a total niche, and for that, you wouldn't need 8 decimal points\\n* In the latter, that makes of Bitcoin a $2.1 quadrillion network, and that would mean that Satoshi mentally utilized sats as the implied unit of account, and that is not consistent with the following quote\\n\\n>there's only going to be 21 million coins\\n\\nI'm thinking the theoretical contradiction I find might lie in how computers handle numbers internally (floating point arithmetic, as was shared in a link on another comment)\"\n \"Note that, while Mike Hearn has CLAIMED that Satoshi sent that to him in an email, I don't think Satoshi himself has ever confirmed that he actually sent it, nor has Mike Hearn supplied any proof that the message was actually received from Satoshi.\\n\\nIt's likely, even probable, that Mike actually received the message AND that Satoshi actually sent it. However, without sufficient proof, there's a very real possibility that Satoshi never actually wrote that.\"\n \"The Bitcoin code doesn't ACTUALLY divide the amount in half. Instead, it performs a bitwise shift on an integer value. This has an effect equivalent to dividing by 2 and throwing away any remainder. However, what's actually happening is just shifting the bits over on the computer's binary representation until there aren't any bits left.\"\n 'What is the number 5 billion you are referencing?'\n '32 is also 2^5. Or more preceicely, loge(32) = 5.'\n \"Oh that's interesting. So you're saying that 32 halvings is not an active decision, but rather the consequence of three decisions: limit the supply to 21M coins (or 2.1 quadrillion really as you mention), 50 bitcoins or 5 billion sats as block reward in the first epoch, and supply issuance cutting in half every epoch\"\n 'I mean this is very close, the answer is that 7 is the number of God in the Bible and 3 is the most holy number in the world.

Then the decimal is just moved over 8 places by wallets and block explorers for display purposes to make the numbers that we see.'\n 'This other answer with a link on it also hints in the same direction: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jknfpz/comment/mjwrbk3/?utm\\\\_source=share&utm\\\\_medium=web3x&utm\\\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\\\_term=1&utm\\\\_content=share\\\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jknfpz/comment/mjwrbk3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)'\n 'Thanks! Can you link the sources of those numbers? Would be interesting to look at\\n\\nAlso, probably not making any difference, but I guess Satoshi must have been working off of (latest) 2008 data. By Jan 3, 2009 the software was running, so code must have been written throughout 2008 (or at least since Oct 31, 2008)'\n 'What is with 42? Also mentioned in another comment'\n \"The numbers are definitely in the source code. However, there isn't any explanation in the source code about WHY that particular number was used instead of some other number.\"\n \"Thats the value that Satoshi chose for the block reward for the first 210,000 blocks before it got cut in half the first time.  Most people think it's 50.0 bitcoins, but in the blockchain and in transactions there aren't actually any decimals. Everything is stored and represented as an integer number of Satoshis. Then the wallet software and block explorer software moves the decimal place over 8 places to show it to us humans.\\n\\nSo, the block reward started at 5,000,000,000 Satoshis. Then it got cut in half to 2,500,000,000 Satoshis, and so on until now it's 312,500,000 Satoshis. \\n\\nSince the values are stored as integers, eventually when cut in half there will be a fraction that will just get thrown away. So, the reward will get cut in half from 9,765,625 Satoshis (0.09765625 BTC) resulting in 4,882,812 Satoshis (notice that it's rounded down to avoid the 0.5 decimal portion).\"\n 'It appears likely that the starting point of 5 billion units per block and the \"halving\" (actually a bitwise shift on the integer value) were the active decisions. The eventual total supply is just a natural consequence of those two decisions.\\n\\nNote that the actual eventual total supply is LESS than the commonly stated \"21M BTC\".  That\\'s just a rounded up number which is easier to remember and easier to say.  The actual total supply would have been only 2,099,999,997,690,000 units (20,999,999.9769 BTC) if there hadn\\'t been some early software bugs in the Bitcoin mining software.\\n\\nDue to those bugs, some bitcoins weren\\'t created, and therefore will never exist, and some additional bitcoins were removed from existence after having been created. An analysis was done in 2014 (as of block number 305,303) which found that 135.20897146 BTC of the expected 12,882,575 BTC at that time were missing and would never be replaced. That further reduced the eventual total supply to 20,999,864.76792854 BTC.'\n 'There are obviously a lot of people who believe in mystic numbers in the Bible (ie Kabbalah).

Some of them make good sense (like the exponentially decreasing issuance rate), some are arbitrary like the two week readjustment.
