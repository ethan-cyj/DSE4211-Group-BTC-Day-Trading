         "Back in a simpler, more innocent era, from around 2012-2014, when I was still young, dumb, and full of Bitcoin enthusiasm, it used to be that I couldn't stop talking about Bitcoin. To anyone who would listen, and more than a few people who wouldn't. \"We just met? You've said absolutely nothing to indicate an interest in hearing about this subject? You haven't mentioned a single topic that's even tangentially related? You're in this country as a tourist and don't actually speak much English? You actually just stopped me to ask directions to the nearest restroom?  Well, hey, if you're looking for a place that's full of shit, let me tell you a little about something called 'the Federal Reserve'...\" In hindsight, at times, my Bitcoin evangelism may even have bordered on the slightly obnoxious.  \n\nBut I was a different man back then, no more than a boy really. That was before the horrors I witnessed in the trenches of the Great Block Size War. In more recent years, when someone in my circle who still thinks of me as \"the Bitcoin guy\" asks me a Bitcoin-related question, my response has tended to be more along the lines of:  <takes long drag on cigarette and stares into the middle distance> \"It's... complicated. How much time you got? Never mind. I guess the real question is how much energy do *I* have? Probably not enough. So, um, yeah, sure, buy some shares of the Bitcoin ETF if you want. I don't know. Maybe that'll work out for you.\"\n\nBut now, with the release of this book, I finally have something I can simply hand people, and tell them: \"You *really* want to know the story behind Bitcoin? The *true* story? Read this.\"\n\nI was actually a little nervous when this book was announced. Because this is a story that was crying out to be told, or at least to finally be told in one place and in a somewhat \"definitive\" manner. So I *really* hoped that Roger and Steve would get it right. And I'm pleased to report that they did. The book is *phenomenal*, certainly better than I expected it to be, and even better than I hoped it would be. I read it primarily so that I'd know if it was something I could recommend to others.  I didn't think I needed to read it for *myself*, because, after all, [\"I lived it.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hApP4_2wtiU) I had watched in real time as the \"hijacking\" described in the book unfolded, and fought unsuccessfully to stop it.  But I was mistaken. While I knew perhaps 85% of the story that's outlined in this book, there was a good 15% of events and connections that I didn't know.  And even much of what I did know, I'd forgotten. After all, these events took place over a several-year period that now stretches back over a decade. The impact of seeing them all laid out together in a clear, comprehensive and yet still succinct narrative was *extremely* powerful. \n\nAfter finishing the book, I couldn't help but think: \"I don't see how *anyone* who's actually operating in good faith could read this book and *not* agree with the conclusion that the Bitcoin project was hijacked.\" Of course, the more realistic part of me knows from bitter experience that motivated reasoning driven by things like tribalism and an unwillingness to admit error is a *very* powerful thing. But still, this is absolutely a book that *can* change minds and open eyes. Buy it. Read it. Share it.",

I've held BTC and BCH before, and I have also listened to the counter-audiobook, \"The Blocksize War\".\n\n\"Hijacking Bitcoin\" is an excellent book.  It should be read/listened to by anyone interested in hearing all sides the Bitcoin story.\n\nIt felt like hearing the perspective of the side who just lost a war.  Big blockers may have been righteous, but they lost.  I came away feeling like big blocks are true to the original Bitcoin vision, and would enable Bitcoin to have the greatest impact, particularly for the world's poorer people, but those things didn't matter in the end.\n\nThe book is a truly brutal smear of the current BTC.  It honestly did real damage to my conviction in BTC, and I don't think I can ever listen to Micheal Saylor again.\n\nTY Roger Ver for the excellent book.  I've consumed a lot of content about cryptocurrency and bitcoin, and this book was an incredibly insightful and unique meal in my diet of crypto-content.",

I used to follow this sub but stopped following when all I saw was posts about BCH instead of BTC, which is literally in the sub's name, but reading some comments here made me realize that things might be more nuanced that I originally thought here (I mean, I don't see the toxicity of Buttcoin nor the irrationality of reciting the Bitcoin Standard as the bibble).\n\nNow, I've been discussing lately with some BCH supporters, and although I have to recognize that BCH is technically superior to BTC, the thing is that the market decided that BTC was more valuable, even laughable things such as dogecoin and XRP are more valuable to the market right now than BCH, I mean, at the time of writing there are more transactions happening on [BTC's testnet](https://mempool.space/testnet) that there are happening on [BCH's main net.](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash)\n\nI have told many times, to many people, that yes, Digital Gold (or Property if you want to use the word that's gaining traction due to Saylor's narrative) won over Digital Cash, but that doesn't mean that BTC will be hindered forever as a MoE, we've seen that Lightning works great only when fees are low so realistically the solution would be to either scale on-chain or get everyone into the hands of custodians, which I think won't be what the market really wants, and the consensus around BTC is becoming more a more clear every day that we need to scale and the filter/smallblock/ossification cult has to fuck off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my theory is that Bitcoin (BTC) will eventually evolve into what BCH is today, but keeping its history and not BCH's, what would you guys think if this ever comes to be real? Would you feel vindicated even if when you know that you went to \"the wrong chain\"? Would you fight it? Would you simply abide to what the market tells? Would you, in case you're a researcher or developer, help the development of BTC even knowing well how people were treated during the Blocksize war?",

I recall staying up late many nights reading the debates and attempting to grok the arguments from both sides even with my limited technical knowledge at the time.   I was more naturally drawn to the big blocker side because it more closely matched the original reason I was excited about bitcoin.  You know the whole peer to peer electronic cash system thing that was so revolutionary at the time.  \n\nI recall small blockers made many big claims about what would happen if bitcoin allowed bigger blocks, as an attempt to scare people away from using bigger blocks, and now that we can look back after many years of success with BCH we know that a majority of these claims were totally false.

         "I see some mis-information circulating about this. Here is what happened:\n\nUsers /u/ThomasZander and /u/ShadowOfHarbringer just removed me as the top moderator of r/bitcoincash, **effectively changing ownership of the sub**. I was not aware they could do this, nor do I wish they did so. I have been the top moderator of that sub since day 1 of its existence, and I guarded it against takeover and threats-- until now. I am no longer able to do this.\n\nThese two users were able to do this because of a rule change Reddit made a few months ago that I was unaware of.\n\nI have been active as a user, regularly logging in. This normally would have been enough to maintain my active status as a moderator. Prior to this rule change, Reddit would only gave up a sub-reddit if the moderators were inactive *as users* for more than 90 days. I was not inactive in this way.\n\nReddit changed the rules recently to require moderators to be active with *moderator-specific actions*, which I had not taken, even though I was active as a user and logging in regularly.\n\nThis is quite disappointing. I haven't been able to keep up with all of the moderator rule changes that Reddit has made recently, and it has cost me my sub.\n\nRegarding another /r/bitcoincash mod, /u/althornton2462, what he is saying is true: He removed the censorship of /u/georgedonnelly that /u/ThomasZander and /u/ShadowOfHarbringer put in place. I agree with /u/althornton2462's action of unbanning George Donnelly. In my opinion, George should not have been banned from the sub. But regardless, this is being used as one of the \"reasons\" the takeover was \"legitimate\". It is a topic for discussion and does not warrant the taking over of an entire sub. Don't let them convince you that this warrants their actions.\n\n/u/althornton2462 described what happened [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1bkjrrc/comment/kvypb1p/). <-- read this\n\nAlso, for those wondering, /u/althornton2462 is *not* George Donnelly. I know this from first-hand experience as I am the one who appointed /u/althornton2462 as moderator. I have also verified, outside of reddit, that the original owner is still the same owner today who controls the /u/althornton2462 account. All accusations that he is somehow George Donnelly are false.\n\nI have served to guard the sub for **7 years** in good faith, and I have kept it in good hands this entire time. This is a tremendous track record in itself-- until that was taken from me today. I can no longer guarantee the security of r/bitcoincash.\n\n/u/ThomasZander and /u/ShadowOfHarbringer, I would appreciate being returned to the top moderator position of [r/bitcoincash](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincash/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n--------\n\n**UPDATE:** Please read my follow-up response to u/ThomasZander where I share my side of events, as they unfolded:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1bkmy0p/notice_the_rbitcoincash_sub_has_been_taken/kw4t4dn/",

There has been no claim of mass bans or widespread post deletions. The entire drama ultimately revolves around a single, solitary individual who was banned by the mod team.\n\nFrom what's been shared by LovelyDayHere, who is a very reliable mod, it appears that the decision to ban the individual came after an extensive debate. It wasn't a snap decision, unlike what happened today. It was the result of the mod team working together and sorting through all the facts with due process.\n\nIt should be noted that the individual in question has a very long history of being disruptive. They were right at the epicenter of the last BCH split, in fact, and have a negative history in other crypto communities.\n\nSo now the entire subreddit is infighting, all because of the one individual. Again. What more evidence is needed?\n\nIt's clear that the decision to oust the disruptive individual was the correct one.",

Everyone who is already discussing here will just continue to want to discuss why the discussion has been ruined.\n\nThe only alternative to a change back towards where things started, is for the \"free speech\" advocates / mods to begin hypocritically censoring meta posts discussing why mods were changed despite huge community outcry.

The user was not warned about what type of conduct they should abstain from. Reading their recent comments, I can guess what the offense was.\n\nThough it has me wondering, would they be treated this way if they where not extremely critical of the new mod team and u/althornton2462 in particular? Probably not. So there you go, the politicaly motivated purges by way of strict application of mod rules to undesirables have already begun, just like they did in r/bitcoin under u/theymos rule.\n\nWhat was that about erring on the side of free speech and no censorship in r/btc, ah you the sweet smell of hypocrisy. The loudest virtue signalers who drama manufactured themselves into their current position immediately turn around doing exactly what they accuse everybody else of doing.\n\nShame on you u/althornton2462 and u/MemoryDealers\n\n[vote here if u/althornton2462 should be removed as mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1bl0f9b/poll_should_ualthornton2462_step_downbe_removed/)\n\nEdit 1: u/althornton2462 claims the ban is for violating reddits TOS for „attacking a sub“. Obviously this is an interpretation by u/althornton2462 of criticidm of mods as an attack on the sub. Which is funny, because criticism of mods is how u/althornton2462 managed to powertrip and takeover r/btc, and attacking a sub was what George was banned for.\n\nEdit2: u/althornton2462 was removed as mod by u/memorydealers because of their power tripping actions.

         "I've just found out that this sub is not just a bunch of people who hate Bitcoin Core because they decided to go for segwit instead of XT. I used to follow this sub but stopped following when all I saw was posts about BCH instead of BTC, which is literally in the sub's name, but reading some comments here made me realize that things might be more nuanced that I originally thought here (I mean, I don't see the toxicity of Buttcoin nor the irrationality of reciting the Bitcoin Standard as the bibble).\n\nNow, I've been discussing lately with some BCH supporters, and although I have to recognize that BCH is technically superior to BTC, the thing is that the market decided that BTC was more valuable, even laughable things such as dogecoin and XRP are more valuable to the market right now than BCH, I mean, at the time of writing there are more transactions happening on [BTC's testnet](https://mempool.space/testnet) that there are happening on [BCH's main net.](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash)\n\nI have told many times, to many people, that yes, Digital Gold (or Property if you want to use the word that's gaining traction due to Saylor's narrative) won over Digital Cash, but that doesn't mean that BTC will be hindered forever as a MoE, we've seen that Lightning works great only when fees are low so realistically the solution would be to either scale on-chain or get everyone into the hands of custodians, which I think won't be what the market really wants, and the consensus around BTC is becoming more a more clear every day that we need to scale and the filter/smallblock/ossification cult has to fuck off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my theory is that Bitcoin (BTC) will eventually evolve into what BCH is today, but keeping its history and not BCH's, what would you guys think if this ever comes to be real? Would you feel vindicated even if when you know that you went to \"the wrong chain\"? Would you fight it? Would you simply abide to what the market tells? Would you, in case you're a researcher or developer, help the development of BTC even knowing well how people were treated during the Blocksize war?",

         "This Reddit post is indeed relevant to Bitcoin news. It discusses the potential for Bitcoin (BTC) to evolve into a different form similar to Bitcoin Cash (BCH), despite BCH's initial development from a fork of Bitcoin Core, and how users might react if this were to happen.\n\nThe post touches on several topics related to the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as:\n\n1. Market acceptance: The fact that BTC is more valuable in the market than BCH.\n2. Scalability solutions: The discussion around on-chain scaling or using custodians.\n3. Community dynamics: The filter/smallblock/ossification cult and its impact on the community.\n\nThe post also invites users to share their thoughts on whether they would feel vindicated, fight it, or abide by market demands if BTC were to evolve into a new form similar to BCH. This adds a layer of speculation and exploration to the discussion, making it relevant to Bitcoin news."

I recall staying up late many nights reading the debates and attempting to grok the arguments from both sides even with my limited technical knowledge at the time.   I was more naturally drawn to the big blocker side because it more closely matched the original reason I was excited about bitcoin.  You know the whole peer to peer electronic cash system thing that was so revolutionary at the time.  \n\nI recall small blockers made many big claims about what would happen if bitcoin allowed bigger blocks, as an attempt to scare people away from using bigger blocks, and now that we can look back after many years of success with BCH we know that a majority of these claims were totally false.  Can you guys help me compile a list of the most prominent failed arguments from small blockers in 2017.",

         "I see some mis-information circulating about this. Here is what happened:\n\nUsers /u/ThomasZander and /u/ShadowOfHarbringer just removed me as the top moderator of r/bitcoincash, **effectively changing ownership of the sub**. I was not aware they could do this, nor do I wish they did so. I have been the top moderator of that sub since day 1 of its existence, and I guarded it against takeover and threats-- until now. I am no longer able to do this.\n\nThese two users were able to do this because of a rule change Reddit made a few months ago that I was unaware of.\n\nI have been active as a user, regularly logging in. This normally would have been enough to maintain my active status as a moderator. Prior to this rule change, Reddit would only gave up a sub-reddit if the moderators were inactive *as users* for more than 90 days. I was not inactive in this way.\n\nReddit changed the rules recently to require moderators to be active with *moderator-specific actions*, which I had not taken, even though I was active as a user and logging in regularly.\n\nThis is quite disappointing. I haven't been able to keep up with all of the moderator rule changes that Reddit has made recently, and it has cost me my sub.\n\nRegarding another /r/bitcoincash mod, /u/althornton2462, what he is saying is true: He removed the censorship of /u/georgedonnelly that /u/ThomasZander and /u/ShadowOfHarbringer put in place. I agree with /u/althornton2462's action of unbanning George Donnelly. In my opinion, George should not have been banned from the sub. But regardless, this is being used as one of the \"reasons\" the takeover was \"legitimate\". It is a topic for discussion and does not warrant the taking over of an entire sub. Don't let them convince you that this warrants their actions.\n\n/u/althornton2462 described what happened [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1bkjrrc/comment/kvypb1p/). <-- read this\n\nAlso, for those wondering, /u/althornton2462 is *not* George Donnelly. I know this from first-hand experience as I am the one who appointed /u/althornton2462 as moderator. I have also verified, outside of reddit, that the original owner is still the same owner today who controls the /u/althornton2462 account. All accusations that he is somehow George Donnelly are false.\n\nI have served to guard the sub for **7 years** in good faith, and I have kept it in good hands this entire time. This is a tremendous track record in itself-- until that was taken from me today. I can no longer guarantee the security of r/bitcoincash.\n\n/u/ThomasZander and /u/ShadowOfHarbringer, I would appreciate being returned to the top moderator position of [r/bitcoincash](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincash/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n--------\n\n**UPDATE:** Please read my follow-up response to u/ThomasZander where I share my side of events, as they unfolded:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/1bkmy0p/notice_the_rbitcoincash_sub_has_been_taken/kw4t4dn/",

It was the result of the mod team working together and sorting through all the facts with due process.\n\nIt should be noted that the individual in question has a very long history of being disruptive. They were right at the epicenter of the last BCH split, in fact, and have a negative history in other crypto communities.\n\nSo now the entire subreddit is infighting, all because of the one individual.

         "I've just found out that this sub is not just a bunch of people who hate Bitcoin Core because they decided to go for segwit instead of XT. I used to follow this sub but stopped following when all I saw was posts about BCH instead of BTC, which is literally in the sub's name, but reading some comments here made me realize that things might be more nuanced that I originally thought here (I mean, I don't see the toxicity of Buttcoin nor the irrationality of reciting the Bitcoin Standard as the bibble).\n\nNow, I've been discussing lately with some BCH supporters, and although I have to recognize that BCH is technically superior to BTC, the thing is that the market decided that BTC was more valuable, even laughable things such as dogecoin and XRP are more valuable to the market right now than BCH, I mean, at the time of writing there are more transactions happening on [BTC's testnet](https://mempool.space/testnet) that there are happening on [BCH's main net.](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash)\n\nI have told many times, to many people, that yes, Digital Gold (or Property if you want to use the word that's gaining traction due to Saylor's narrative) won over Digital Cash, but that doesn't mean that BTC will be hindered forever as a MoE, we've seen that Lightning works great only when fees are low so realistically the solution would be to either scale on-chain or get everyone into the hands of custodians, which I think won't be what the market really wants, and the consensus around BTC is becoming more a more clear every day that we need to scale and the filter/smallblock/ossification cult has to fuck off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my theory is that Bitcoin (BTC) will eventually evolve into what BCH is today, but keeping its history and not BCH's, what would you guys think if this ever comes to be real? Would you feel vindicated even if when you know that you went to \"the wrong chain\"? Would you fight it? Would you simply abide to what the market tells? Would you, in case you're a researcher or developer, help the development of BTC even knowing well how people were treated during the Blocksize war?",

It discusses the potential for Bitcoin (BTC) to evolve into a different form similar to Bitcoin Cash (BCH), despite BCH's initial development from a fork of Bitcoin Core, and how users might react if this were to happen.\n\nThe post touches on several topics related to the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as:\n\n1. Market acceptance: The fact that BTC is more valuable in the market than BCH.\n2. Scalability solutions: The discussion around on-chain scaling or using custodians.\n3. Community dynamics: The filter/smallblock/ossification cult and its impact on the community.\n\nThe post also invites users to share their thoughts on whether they would feel vindicated, fight it, or abide by market demands if BTC were to evolve into a new form similar to BCH. This adds a layer of speculation and exploration to the discussion, making it relevant to Bitcoin news."

         " I've noticed a trend lately where many of us are getting caught up in the excitement of price pumps and market speculation. While it's natural to feel exhilarated when the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surges, I believe it's essential for us to maintain perspective and focus on what truly matters: BCH adoption.\n\nAs passionate supporters of Bitcoin Cash, our ultimate goal should be to see widespread adoption of this revolutionary cryptocurrency. We envision a future where BCH is used for everyday transactions, providing people with a fast, reliable, and low-cost means of transferring value across the globe.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile, and price pumps can be short-lived. Moreover, the recent developments surrounding Tether serve as a stark reminder of the risks associated with centralized stablecoins. **If the US government decides to crack down on Tether or other stablecoins, it could have significant implications for the entire crypto market, including BCH.**\n\nInstead of fixating solely on short-term price movements, let's channel our energy into promoting BCH adoption and building the infrastructure necessary for its mainstream use. Here are a few ways we can contribute to the growth of BCH:\n\n1. **Educate Others:** Spread awareness about the benefits of BCH compared to traditional payment systems and other cryptocurrencies. Share informative articles, videos, and resources to help newcomers understand why BCH is worth considering.\n2. **Merchant Adoption:** Encourage businesses to accept BCH as a form of payment. Reach out to local merchants and online retailers, highlighting the advantages of BCH transactions, such as low fees and fast confirmation times.\n3. **Community Outreach:** Organize meetups, workshops, and conferences to connect with fellow BCH enthusiasts and onboard new users. Collaboration and grassroots efforts play a vital role in fostering adoption and building a strong community around BCH.\n4. **Developing Applications:** Support developers working on projects that enhance the BCH ecosystem, such as wallets, decentralized exchanges, and decentralized applications. By contributing to the development of BCH infrastructure, we can make it more accessible and user-friendly for everyone.\n5. **Lead by Example:** Use BCH for your own transactions whenever possible, whether it's buying goods and services or tipping content creators online. Demonstrating the practical utility of BCH helps showcase its real-world value and encourages others to follow suit.\n\nBy prioritizing BCH adoption over price speculation, we can lay the foundation for a more resilient and sustainable future for Bitcoin Cash. Let's stay focused on our long-term vision and work together to make BCH the go-to cryptocurrency for people around the world.\n\nTogether, we can make a difference.\n\nSpend and replace :)",

It discusses the potential for Bitcoin (BTC) to evolve into a different form similar to Bitcoin Cash (BCH), despite BCH's initial development from a fork of Bitcoin Core, and how users might react if this were to happen.\n\nThe post touches on several topics related to the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as:\n\n1. Market acceptance: The fact that BTC is more valuable in the market than BCH.\n2. Scalability solutions: The discussion around on-chain scaling or using custodians.\n3. Community dynamics: The filter/smallblock/ossification cult and its impact on the community.\n\nThe post also invites users to share their thoughts on whether they would feel vindicated, fight it, or abide by market demands if BTC were to evolve into a new form similar to BCH.

A layer 2 called Lightning, riddled with problems, needless complexity and worst of all custodial centralization paths. Why? Just so they can control it and make money off the services they built for it.\\n\\nThat has not and will not work for the rest of the world. It never will. Read the Lightning white paper.\\n\\n\"(K.I.S.S) Keep it simple stupid is a design principle which states that designs and/or systems should be as simple as possible. Wherever possible, complexity should be avoided in a system—as simplicity guarantees the greatest levels of user acceptance and interaction.\" As well might I add, security.\\n\\nRaising the blocksize is simple, compared to the above and it\\'s keeps things non-custodial and decentralized.\\n\\nThe world may not accept it, the world is full of really stupid people but you never know.\\n\\nOne thing I think we can all agree on is eventually the world is gonna really want a p2p digital cash. The demand is growing. And I don\\'t think it\\'s gonna be the mess that is Bitcoin+Lightning. It would make far more sense to convert some of your Bitcoin into Bitcoin Cash   and use that as digital cash when you need to.\\n\\nI don\\'t think most of us here are Maxi\\'s, we will go where the p2p cash utility is but right now a lot of really great development are happening on BCH and about to be released. It\\'s in a very good technical and utility position, only a maxi would deny that.', 'The crippled block/no hardfork cult isnt about scaling. It is about control. It has been cemented in BTCs culture so rigidly, it is impossible to excise. And it is no accident that it makes BTC unusable, that is the purpose. It is also no unfortunate accident that due to BTCs crippled nature, people are herded into centralized/custodial solutions. That is all exactly how the establishment/elites/central banksters want it, something nicely tamed, neutered, controllable, where if need be they can exercise confiscation, censorship, paper-inflation and bail-ins. It is no accident that BTC culture is permeated and soaked in censorship, appeals to authority, begging for tradfi handouts and statism. Scaling BTC, making it usable, would undo all that, and that cant be allowed. BTC has been alotted its reservation to stay in, and it better damn well stay in there or else…\\n\\nAnd even if, by some inconceivable accident, there was to be a hardfork to scale, it would become a minority fork. Except without all the improvements that BCH already made, it would be pointless.', 'Imo, BTC is controlled opposition. You might get Dollar rich, but you won\\'t get free or control over your money.\\n\\nIt is likely that BTC stays the collectors token it has become and is used as an SoV, but it could also crumble and collapse. What it will never become is an alternative MoE to the FIAT system.\\n\\nIf you listen to the guys in charge and their spokspersons you know that. Samson Mow for example or Saylor and his infamous:\" MoE is a distraction\".\\n\\n\\nBCH might never flip BTC but it doesn\\'t even have tom to succeed. The only win condition is that people use it self custodial and create an alternative economy with it. But if that happens, the value of BCH is likely to go up .', '> So my theory is that Bitcoin (BTC) will eventually evolve into what BCH is today, but keeping its history and not BCH\\'s, what would you guys think if this ever comes to be real?\\n\\nI find this event to be extremely unlikely for many reasons. One of the reasons is that it takes a lot to change the BTC culture to be supportive of bigger blocks and optimizing for layer-1 non-custodial UTXO ownership. A much stronger reason though, is that if they tried it\\'s more likely that they would convert people who believe in that vision to users of BCH, as that is the lower cost and faster gratification.\\n\\nWe\\'re actually already seeing that happen, people in BTC are warming up to the idea that bigger blocks might make some sense, or that non-custodial ownership of layer-1 UTXOs are important, but they are being fought back against and ridiculed, and are loosing their social status and support. They are then faced with a choice - keep fighting to change BTC, which lacks a clear path to change (no, getting assigned a BIP number is not enough, and having a usecase is not enough, and writing the code is not enough - in the end you need to do all of it **AND** get ACK from the existing gatekeepers) - or ask others who tried before them where they went and follow them there.\\n\\nYou can revisit the BTC/BCH split for a prime example of how this works - some people were well-served (traders, speculators) while some were poorly served (merchants, layer-1 users) and so over the years prior to the BTC/BCH split people fought to change BTC for what they believed was the better, but their support dwindled over time and more and more other chains offered the solution they were interested in, and so the rebels stopped fighting and moved on to other places instead.\\n\\nNow they\\'re fighting over OP_CAT, CTV and tools that they think will enable the scaling they want, but BTC is still one of the top performer as a speculative asset, and the people who are earning a ton of paper-value (or real, if they realize it) have no motivation to \"improve\" by making risky changes to the underlying protocol.\\n\\nBTC will only learn when it is no longer the speculatively top performer, and by then they will have lost the market and mind share necessary to make the changes in the first place. Or, at least that\\'s how I think it\\'s going to play out.', '\"Good luck\" is my position', \"BCH is full of old-school Bitcoiners. The people that want Bitcoin to be used by everyone, every day, so it eventually replaces existing fiat systems. That's a threat to the existing systems...\\n\\nIf you were under threat by Bitcoin what would you do to stop it?\\n\\nPreventing its usage (limiting the blocksize) and making it expensive to use (high-fee design) sounds like a good strategy.\\n\\nAnd because Bitcoin has falling block rewards every 4 years you just need to keep delaying its usage, eventually strangling miner revenue, until the mining network shrinks to small enough that it can be easily attacked.\\n\\nEven something like a temporary 1-week long attack, making the entire network unusable, would instantly destroy the entire networks credibility and cause the remainder of the miners revenue (fees from usage+price) to evaporate, further destroying the miners.\\n\\nBTC is on the slow-strangulation path.\\n\\nYou admit that BCH is superior, but the market chose the inferior option ... for now. Sounds like [an opportunity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbA_h_3Beco). :)\", 'BTC is really an antique at this point- what do we do with Antiques? We collect them, store them and eventually sell them for a profit or make them part of our estate as part of inheritance . BCH is a usable solution that scales- it may too become an antique one day as this tech continues at a staggering rate. Question- why not hold both? My Bet is BCH sees outsized returns as more people investigate the history of Bitcoin … once you do that you realize BCH is the old school BTC simply scaled up for use.', \"BTC could raise the block limit, but they won't (or if they do, its won't be nearly enough of a raise to function like bch) \\n\\nEver since the capture of Bitcoin, their point\\nwas to carve out space for middle-man profit in transactions. They are using level2 to recreate the traditional banking system instead of destroying it. \\n\\nSo no, they won't be a competitor for BCH, thats not their goal. It's like asking if Kim Jong Un could decide to free the people of NK. Theoretically it's easy and he could do it any time, but most likely not because he profits from the control.\", '>So my theory is that Bitcoin (BTC) will eventually evolve into what BCH is today, but keeping its history and not BCH\\'s, what would you guys think if this ever comes to be real? \\n\\nIt\\'s delusional to think it will ever come to that, because if it were at all possible, it would have happened during the block size wars. It\\'s no accident the BTC is crippled. Custodial solutions are the end goal, and self-ownership will not be allowed, no matter what the market \"wants\".\\n\\n>Would you feel vindicated even if when you know that you went to \"the wrong chain\"?\\n\\nIf it does happen, contrary to my expectations, I wouldn\\'t mind at all. I don\\'t really care if it\\'s called BTC or BCH, all I want is to be my own bank and to use the money that works. I was big supporter of BTC when it used to work, and I stopped using it when the fees became unreasonable. I don\\'t see it as being on \"the wrong chain\". \\n\\n>Would you fight it? Would you simply abide to what the market tells? \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t fight it, but I wouldn\\'t help it. Block sizes were kept small to \"avoid the hard fork\". Now that the BCH fork happened anyway, it\\'s just easier to use what works, than to change what doesn\\'t want to be changed. Most people on the \"right chain\" don\\'t even care if it works or not, as long as number goes up. And once it stops going up, they\\'ll be happy to sell, it\\'s much easier than to build.', 'The market never stops deciding. The Euro, USD, BTC, Oil, Nike, Apple.... will all be replaced eventually.', 'As soon as current BTC accepts BCH as the right path it is easier to jump ship or hard fork BTC blockchain to a coin concept that already exists? \\n\\nNot an easy question. BTC has infiltrated traditional finance quite a bit. Maybe you are right that changing it is at the end more convenient. Depends how much use BCH and BTC have and who moves larger volumes when that happens.', 'Increasing the blocksize on a schedule set by a central cabal is definitely in the stars, getting rid of RBF not so much.\\n\\nSo... no, BTC will not gain the technological advantages  BCH has.', 'If BTC raise the block size that would be great. It is either BCH price raise to pass BTC or BTC price drop to the price of BCH. Or they get some kind of even out. Whatever happens BCH does not get affected. Besides, it shows that people of BCH has been the winner all along. So they probably will still be the winner in the future to come. In fact you or anyone can copy the code of BCH and start your own coin right now. And I don’t mind you do.\\xa0', \"> So my theory is that Bitcoin (BTC) will eventually evolve into what BCH is today, but keeping its history and not BCH's, what would you guys think if this ever comes to be real?\\n\\nI really really hope that a coin which can be used as a MoE (and has other Bitcoin attributes) gets to become the top coin. And if this is how it happens (i.e. BTC adapts and becomes BCH) then great that's what it is.\\n\\nBUT, I don't think it will happen, either way, this is the decision matrix.\\n\\n1. Either BTC becomes BCH on it's own (like almost immediately). In which case, I stood by a noble idea.\\n2. BTC refuses to do it until Hannibal's elephants come knocking at the door (i.e BCH gains 2nd market cap or at least 3rd). Then BTC changes. It might be too late, but if it isn't, it's the first case scenario.\\n3. BTC never changes and tries to keep the digital gold narrative alive, in which case it leaves the market for hundreds of coins to be MoE, and BCH has the best chance to outshine there.\", \">I don't see the toxicity of Buttcoin nor the irrationality of reciting the Bitcoin Standard as the bibble\\n\\nThumbs up.\\n\\n>the market decided that BTC was more valuable, even laughable things such as dogecoin and XRP are more valuable to the market right now than BCH\\n\\nThe market is very volatile.

Note that the goal of BCH is not to flip BTC, though. We are interested in flipping fiat.\", \"So a lot of people hear talk about more people wanting BTC as a store of value than BCH, but this is not my observation of what has happened. \\n\\nAll crypto has suffered a body blow to acceptance: in London there used to be many places that would accept BCH and or BTC, but now there are very few. The man in the street has formed the opinion that Crypto is the realm of scammers.  And its going to take a lot to change their minds. \\n\\n\\\\*People\\\\* have stopped using BTC massively, and to a lessor degree BCH, which is very sad because so much good seemed to be on the way from widespread BCH adoption when BTC became unuseable. But BTC has moved on, People dont much use BTC, now ETF's, do.  The whole ETF thing is massive compared to the previous customers who where private whales.  \\n\\nSo the problem for BCH adoption is hostility towards Crypto generally, and financial regulations against ETF's in general.  \\n\\nAdoption is a worthy goal, but we still have a way to go overcoming the general crypto hostility of the public.\", 'BCH will be north of 10k in the next few years.

I engage in this group because it\\'s accepting and amenable to that position, and really that\\'s the core mission of this community, it encourages discussion of these topics. I\\'ll take any set of technologies that gives me the end result of peer to peer electronic cash.\\n\\nIf BTC \"evolved into\" BCH, that would be good. That\\'s what the BCH people wanted to happen in the first place! How does this evolution happen? Not by itself, someone proposes an improvement and it gets adopted. If BCH is technically superior to BTC as you say, why were those improvements not accepted? Why would they ever be? \"Evolution\" happens via forks. Why be late to the game?\\n\\nPersonally I don\\'t think your proposed outcome is likely. BTC people just have their heels dug in with regard to block size. By the time they do it it will be too late. Transaction fees will asymptotically approach the median transaction value, people will go \"hey, this can\\'t really work unless you\\'re rich\", \"crypto doesn\\'t work see?\" except some people will notice that it\\'s not a problem with all of it, and some of those will decide to use other things. What do you think is the biggest market, hodlers and speculators and hedge funds or 8 billion human beings? BTC will lose long term. Not necessarily to BCH, but it will lose to something because of it\\'s unwillingness to be what people want it to be.', \"You said it in your title. If BTC tries to hard fork to bigger blocks, it will just create another BCH - an altcoin. As long as the old 1MB compatible chain is continued, then that will retain the brand. And the old chain will always be extended because the small block miners can reorg the big block miners, but not vice versa. This is the strategic imbalance built into the block size limit that the small blockers figured out.\\n\\n\\nSo as long as there's an incentive to continue the backwards compatible chain, then BTC can never safely upgrade.\\n\\n\\nAnd there will always be an incentive to continue the backwards compatible chain.\", 'I believe both can coexist, we might see a ramp between both in the future', 'Even if BTC increased the blocksize they are still stuck with segwith and the “central planner” dev that love to play around with the economic characteristic of the project and tell everyone what/how the project is meant to be used for.\\n\\nBitcoin was supposed to free us from trust in politics/banker and it replaced it with dev ….

This think might happen simply because (if Bitcoin has been really captured), there won\\'t be any value in something that simply recreates the traditional system with a different unit of account.\\n\\nAt least that\\'s my opinion, I might be completely wrong.', 'Well said!', '> the people who are earning a ton of paper-value (or real, if they realize it) have no motivation to \"improve\" by making risky changes to the underlying protocol\\n\\nThis inertia is way underrated!

It was more than simple units of account, and included a scripting system and op codes. This could allow many types of contracts to be created. However, like the temporary block size, the scripting was never improved upon over time and it got stuck.\\n\\nVitalik wanted to create smart contracts on Bitcoin in 2013. Unfortunately with Satoshi disappearing, his efforts were rejected by Bitcoin and so he started Ethereum as a proof of concept project. In a way, Ethereum was the first schism from Bitcoin.\\n\\n2013 to 2016 was a dark period, where the conflict of number go up vs disruptive money arose. Established financial interests froze and regressed Bitcoin, while financially paying off the devs and bag holders.\\n\\nIn 2017 Bitcoin finally split into two coins, BTC and BCH.

That, and he had the beliefs and actions of someone I thought was consistent with Satoshi Nakamoto.\\n\\n>My false belief in Craig Wright would go on to damage me financially in truly spectacular fashion. Because Craig told me to use Bitcoin Cash immediately after it launched, believing this was coming from Satoshi Nakamoto, a figure I idolized, I invested my personal savings into Bitcoin Cash and pivoted my business to focus exclusively on Bitcoin Cash. This would turn out to be a disaster in time, as Bitcoin Cash became BSV, and continuously fell in price and adoption.\\n\\n>I used to be a big holder of Bitcoin. I sold all of it to support Craig Wright. Not only did my investments not pan out, but I have missed the giant bull run on Bitcoin as a consequence, even though I am an OG going back to 2011. I am out at least tens of millions of dollars, possibly more. The true scale of the losses will be determined when I account for all of my records.\\n\\n>I realized I had failed in 2020. My business was not profitable, it was not growing, and I realized the technology I had been using exclusively, BSV, had very low prospects of success. I simply had to admit to myself my only option was to exit. I managed to sell the company and then began the long process of unwinding my belief system.\\n\\n>From 2020 until now, I have spent a lot of time ruminating on the trauma I experienced from 2017 - 2020. Now that we know Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto, I understand. I was a cult member and was being manipulated by a psychopath who did not care if he ruined me so long as he had perceived near-term benefit.\\n\\n>One of the reasons why it took me so long to accept that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto is that it would have to be a truly huge scam that would ultimately hurt everyone and even himself. Unfortunately, as I have learned, this is a known pattern of behavior for psychopaths. Craig Wright will indeed get his day in court, again, as the number of people he has hurt is enormous, and it is now established in court he has been lying this whole time. Lawsuits are inevitable.\\n\\n>It took four years of meditation and relaxation to grapple with the scope of my error. Even after all that time, I am still in shock with the declarations that came from the judge. The totality of evidence is overwhelming. Craig Wright is simply not Satoshi Nakamoto, and there was never a reason to believe that he was. I was totally wrong in a big way. Evidently, I am not as smart as I thought.\\n\\n>I estimate I am only about 50% of the way detoxed from the cult, even after four years, as I am still learning to accept that there was never any convincing evidence he was Satoshi Nakamoto, and everything I thought I knew was all lies. Fortunately, there is an emerging network of survivors who are in touch and can lend each other support to grapple with the emotions involved in exiting a cult.\\n\\n>Craig Wright was enabled by Calvin Ayre and Stefan Matthews, his co-conspirators going back to 2016 or earlier. While I cannot say for sure what happened from before 2017, I do know that the three of them orchestrated this giant scam. I know this from personal experience, and I am certain evidence exists to link them. Together, they have caused a catastrophe for anyone who got involved with them from the beginning until now.\\n\\n>Please be kind to the remaining cult members.

This was the path Theymos chose.\n\nAlso, feel free to head over to /r/BitcoinCash.\n\nDiscuss =)",

(especially with the new rules) I don't know. Let's ask what u/BitcoinIsTehFuture thinks is the best for Bitcoin Cash & r/BitcoinCash\", \"Ok but you're forgetting that there are also massive developers in bitcoin and also a huge network with 150x the hash rate of btc cash.\", \"No idea what you mean by 'legal' forks, but there are plenty others, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin platinum (this was mainly a wallet scam though) Saying forks expand the 21million cap is pretty dumb.  \\n  \\nAlso most crypto subs will ban you (this one probably the exception) if you go in there arguing about how some other crypto is better etc.  \\nGo to a generic crypto sub if you want to debate alternatives.\", 'Your comments here make you sound like an idiot, to be fair. Maybe you should not have been banned for being an idiot, but perhaps you refuse to learn when people educate you? If so, you could be seen as a concern troll, who doesn’t care about reality and just wants to spread low IQ FUD. This is harmless in isolation, but it can mislead newbies and waste the community’s time dealing with someone who has no interest in learning, or perhaps no ability to learn.', 'he is still the founder and they took it away from them, nothing is going to change that, even when you morally try defend it, good luck with that.   \\nnot sure what your fixation with me but good luck with that as well, maybe go out touch some grass', 'That is true but the hash rate is only so high because with higher price , more people join to mine bitcoin .\\n\\nBut what would happen if Bitcoin cash price goes 10x and all of a sudden mining it becomes more lucrative than bitcoin ? I tell you what, miners will start progressively joining the network while abandoning bitcoin network which would up the hash rate of Bitcoin cash and lower the one on Bitcoin \\n\\nThe hash rate is super dependent on the price in the end of the day.\\n\\nThere is also another big issue with bitcoin for me and that’s people claim how it’s decentralized but a few players like MicroStrategy , grayscale even the US government can single handidly destroy it because they have so many bitcoins that they can crush the price with ease.\\n\\nIf MicroStrategy for any reason alone decides to dump all of its holdings , they can dip the price probably to 10 000$ or even less and still have plenty of coins to keep sellling to keep it below 10 000 for a long time.\\n\\nThat’s way too much power over people’s savings in a private corporation.', 'Right I am such an idiot that I got my money 10x from\\nThe start of this year, guess how? By NOT investing into Bitcoin but in other cryptos.\\n\\nYou can keep your pink glasses and read and educate yourself all you want but the truth is Bitcoin is nowhere the only or the best crypto to invest in any shape or form.\\n\\nUnless you have bought it 10 years ago.\\n\\nSo thanks for your advice but no thanks I rather be uneducated with 10x gains than be a bitcoin maxi thinking it’s the best , the only one and so on', \"I appreciate the supporting comments, u/xGsGt.\\n\\nIt's up to the r/bitcoincash moderators to do what ever they want.

And that's also not counting the total amount because a lot of BTC has been lost forever. \\n\\nSo there is a chance at price manipulation. \\n\\nHowever, the quicker the ascent of BTC, the more difficult it will be for any one player to have enough to really do anything long term. \\n\\nIt's kind of like gold right now. Yes some mining company could buy the biggest mines and hoard it and then dump it on the market, but the price will then go to where it should be.\\n\\n\\nNow if all major holders decided to buy and sell... well then that's a problem\", 'Exactly, thanks for proving my point. Your reply should demonstrate to you exactly why you got banned. It’s the top bitcoin subreddit, it’s not r/ cryptocurrency. They are not interested in “crypto” guys pushing non-bitcoin cryptos.\\n\\nAnd you 10xing your money is irrelevant, idiots accidentally make money, what matters is if and when you sell and thus lock the 10x in, also longterm how you do (do you think your beginner’s luck means you are a genius and gamble it again on trash, and this time lose it?), and also if your rationale that caused you to buy and be up 10x is actually a sound rationale or if it is BS (meaning your 10x is luck). — From your comments in this thread, you have no idea what you are talking about, which means you merely got lucky, which means most probably you will lose that 10x gain sooner or later.', \"> However, the quicker the ascent of BTC, the more difficult it will be for any one player to have enough to really do anything long term. \\n\\n\\nAn issue is they get to **enforce** the status quo, many Bitcoiners are under the impression that BTC will be able to hard fork for bigger blocks **should it need to** so more people can self custody.\\n\\n\\nBlackrock have in their T's & C's that **they** get to choose which fork is BTC **for their users** \\n\\n\\nLet's say BTC did hard fork to enable more plebs to self custody \\n\\n* This is not in Blackrocks best interests as they gain power and control from custodying peoples funds.\\n\\n* They can transact at any fee level, and it wil mostly be done on updating an SQL database.\\n\\n* Blackrock and their ilk **are** the drivers of NgU\\n\\n* They could sell the bigger block fork into the ground. Assuming they didn't put people off even trying by stating their intentions.\\n\\n* Also all the regulated exchanges wil decide which fork gets the ticker\\n\\n* It's much easier to defend the status quo than to enact change, we found that out in 2017 when the Devs  managed to back down the miners and 90% of the businesses.\\n\\nMost of the plebs are not going to sit idly by and watch their life savings go up in smoke, the people who prized p2p cash over NgU have already left.\", 'But gold cannot be even theoretically upped in supply by “the community “ voting. \\n\\nAnd also with gold you can’t just have someone copy/ paste the full gold amount and call it say “Gold cash” but with the same look, same function and same chemical properties , just branded differently.\\n\\nAlso gold can’t be mined everywhere, there are certain countries that are richer in gold than others , meanwhile bitcoin mining can easily be centered mostly in USA due to USA having access to more secure buildings,  after graphic chips and more mining resources in general.\\n\\nWith gold you can’t have that as if say there is more supply in say France, you can’t just get mining equipment in USA and mine the gold for you in France . \\n\\nAlso I am not sure what the Bitcoin liquidity is compared to gold. With gold due to in being a physical thing, you can’t just go an an exchange and dump 1% of its total world supply with just a click of your mouse.\\n\\nBut with bitcoin a company like MS can just load all of their holdings on an exchange and just dump most of them in a matter of minutes if they so chose , or can just gradually keep offloading every day for a few months .\\n\\nWhich is a problem because a major player can dump a lot of coins without a warning and leave and we already see what just a single corporation in Graysacle can do to the price on their own and they haven’t even sold 20% of their holdings. \\n\\nI highly doubt the actual bitcoin liquidity is more than 1% of its MC', 'Nah I am not losing anything . I am just more educated than you and not brainwashed into thinking bitcoin is the only crypto that goes up.\\n\\nI am also not into long term investing, once I reach my goal with one coin I move to another and so far it have worked great. I have been trading since a year ago, I lost a bunch in 2023 , made it all back with handful of profits in 2024 and it’s still early on.\\n\\nAnd if I had put all my money back then in bitcoin I would still have made less altogether than what I have now .\\n\\nYou call me an idiot but the only idiot here is the one who judges people without knowing anything about them, you have no idea how I invest and yet you are already an expert about luck/ skill etc .\\n\\nYou judge me without knowing anything about my portfolio, without knowing anything but a couple posts on Reddit .\\n\\nYea you are so smart, you know all there is about crypto .\\n\\nI am sure with all your knowledge you are driving a lambo and don’t have to ever work since you have it all figured out .\\n\\nGood for you']"

         "Many people are viewing my posts in Hausa language, but some do not understand the purpose behind creating content in Hausa.\n\nHausa is a member of the Afroasiatic language family and is the most widely spoken language within the Chadic branch of that family.\nIt is the largest ethnic group in West and Central Africa. In Nigeria, native Hausa speakers exceed 70 million, and non-native speakers who use Hausa as a second language likely number between 40 and 50 million conservatively.\n\nThis large population, most of whom do not understand English, needs to be aware of the freedom that comes with peer-to-peer transactions. That's why I've started creating videos and publishing articles about Bitcoin Cash in their own language.\n\nThis is my contribution towards the adoption of Bitcoin Cash and helping my Hausa fellows achieve economic freedom.\n\nMunnir \nBchHausa\nFounder and CEO of TechHausa",

With crypto you can send a dollar or a billion dollars to the barista in front of you or a merchant on the other side of the planet, for stupid cheap.  And someone in a poor African village can start to participate in the world economy without anyone's permission or paying fees.  That to me is the interesting part of crypto.  \\nThat all works no matter what the price is.  I just want the price to be stable so that sort of thing can happen without undue risk to such a merchant.  \\n\\nSo I don't care if the answer is BTC or BCH or ETH or some sidechain or L2 or whatever.  I don't care about price.  I care about functionality.

For someone in another nation it might be an issue.\", \"USD is the gold standard worldwide. They rather have that stability.

I mostly use it for various side project hosting.  1209k was the address of an apartment I used to live in at college.  Anyways, so I\\'ve run BTC nodes and electrum nodes for a very long time and one of my nodes ([b.1209k.com](https://b.1209k.com)) was in an old version of electrum as one of the default seed nodes.  Some of those old versions of electrum have a kinda vulnerability.  Namely, if a server sends a message the message will be displayed as a pop-up to the user with URLs clickable.  This of course is a big problem and leads people to downloading malware.  Basically, the user connects to a bad server, the server sends a pop-up that says \"update now - you are out of date\" and gives a link.  People understandably click on the link.  So any hostname in those old versions is a hot commodity for some people to own.\\n\\nAnyways, due to this I\\'ve gotten some big offers on the [1209k.com](https://1209k.com).  They never say it is to scam people out of their money.  There is a good chance the brokers reaching out don\\'t even know, but I\\'ve always said no.  I think I was offered $50k once.  I turned that down.  I mean, I can probably be bought but it would have to be a lot of digits.  I have been in Bitcoin long enough that I am pretty set moneywise.

They go through all the effort to accept crypto, engage in a bunch of promotion and then ... nothing! The reason is that there are still so few owners of it (and, too, those that do are \"hodlers\" and not very good customers).\\n\\nSo I\\'ve been working on a solution by enabling website operators to earn it. It is a crypto-only, cooperative ad network but I think the business model would work in other business sectors. In ours, in order for the advertisers to get the best ad positions, they have to bid and pay with crypto. Their payments then generate commissions to the website that landed the advertiser (and continuously for as long as the advertiser pays). Since there are 2.1 billion websites, this business model will turn many of them into potential crypto-paying customers.\\n\\nWe circle back around to point out that the advertisers will need crypto AND those advertisers are nearly always businesses. This, too, will incentivize them to accept crypto (i.e. since they can use their crypto income to buy better ad position).\\n\\nBasically I believe (and am building the platform) that will be the next phase of crypto when it will be enabling workers to choose to get paid with it (instead of fiat).

As of August 2017, ZHONG thus possessed 50,000 BCH in addition to the 50,000 Bitcoin that ZHONG unlawfully obtained from Silk Road.  ZHONG thereafter exchanged through an overseas cryptocurrency exchange all of the BCH Crime Proceeds for additional Bitcoin, amounting to approximately 3,500 Bitcoin of additional crime proceeds.

         " I've noticed a trend lately where many of us are getting caught up in the excitement of price pumps and market speculation. While it's natural to feel exhilarated when the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surges, I believe it's essential for us to maintain perspective and focus on what truly matters: BCH adoption.\n\nAs passionate supporters of Bitcoin Cash, our ultimate goal should be to see widespread adoption of this revolutionary cryptocurrency. We envision a future where BCH is used for everyday transactions, providing people with a fast, reliable, and low-cost means of transferring value across the globe.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile, and price pumps can be short-lived. Moreover, the recent developments surrounding Tether serve as a stark reminder of the risks associated with centralized stablecoins. **If the US government decides to crack down on Tether or other stablecoins, it could have significant implications for the entire crypto market, including BCH.**\n\nInstead of fixating solely on short-term price movements, let's channel our energy into promoting BCH adoption and building the infrastructure necessary for its mainstream use. Here are a few ways we can contribute to the growth of BCH:\n\n1. **Educate Others:** Spread awareness about the benefits of BCH compared to traditional payment systems and other cryptocurrencies. Share informative articles, videos, and resources to help newcomers understand why BCH is worth considering.\n2. **Merchant Adoption:** Encourage businesses to accept BCH as a form of payment. Reach out to local merchants and online retailers, highlighting the advantages of BCH transactions, such as low fees and fast confirmation times.\n3. **Community Outreach:** Organize meetups, workshops, and conferences to connect with fellow BCH enthusiasts and onboard new users. Collaboration and grassroots efforts play a vital role in fostering adoption and building a strong community around BCH.\n4. **Developing Applications:** Support developers working on projects that enhance the BCH ecosystem, such as wallets, decentralized exchanges, and decentralized applications. By contributing to the development of BCH infrastructure, we can make it more accessible and user-friendly for everyone.\n5. **Lead by Example:** Use BCH for your own transactions whenever possible, whether it's buying goods and services or tipping content creators online. Demonstrating the practical utility of BCH helps showcase its real-world value and encourages others to follow suit.\n\nBy prioritizing BCH adoption over price speculation, we can lay the foundation for a more resilient and sustainable future for Bitcoin Cash. Let's stay focused on our long-term vision and work together to make BCH the go-to cryptocurrency for people around the world.\n\nTogether, we can make a difference.\n\nSpend and replace :)",

As BTC is further interlaced with the US economy/world and giants such as BlackRock/Fidelity are further invested via their holdings in BTC I find it more and more unlikely that the US will take any action against it.\\n\\nYour comment prompted me to do a quick search and I found that this is an ongoing issue for years and that Tether is [cooperating](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-uk-reportedly-looking-20-173342998.html) with the US government. There doesn\\'t seem to be any Tether wrongdoing and what might come of this is license removals or other sactions for the Russian cryptoexchange (I don\\'t know if it is possible to prevent Tether from running in Russia, I imagine that is not possible).\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nI searched a bit more and found this open letter from Tether:\\n\\n   *We have always assisted law enforcement when called upon to act, and we remain fully committed to continuing to work proactively with agencies globally. Tether has and will assist in identifying and freezing addresses subject to sanctions, engaged in illicit activity, or engaged in any form of terrorist financing.*\\xa0\\n\\n\"...Tether uses Chainalysis’s reactor tool and receives secondary market risk reports from this company.\\n\\nThese surveillance tools are regarded as the best solutions for blockchain surveillance and are used by several US government agencies to monitor blockchain activity.\\n\\nTether announced on December 9 that it had begun a voluntary wallet-freezing policy, offering secondary market controls to freeze activity associated with sanctioned persons on the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List...\"  [Yahoo Finance](https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/ec988-tether-unexpected-approach-with-regulators).\\n\\nI think Tether knows that if they get in trouble with the US government they will be banned and might be ruined, so appear to be very open to collaboration and even offering te US government the actual tools to follow the flow of money and even freeze it upon request.\\n\\nThis is a great topic, thank you for bringing it up. It gives me more peace of mind to learn about the Tether-US collaboration.', 'There 0 real usecase for any stablecoin schemes.', 'I wouldn’t be surprised if one day they force close tether and stablecoins, bitcoin price drops heavily as is not P2P cash and obviously people realize: no use = no value. We have to be aware of governments and not underestimate the power they have on their money and the media. They will try to fight as hard as they can. Just imagine for one second this scenario, they force shut stable coin providers, bitcoin isn’t widespread enough as P2P cash and they use the media to spread a big “WE WARNED YOU, IT WAS ALL A BUBBLE BLABLABLA…” many people would believe this argument. \\n\\nWe have to be wise and start onboarding people. From my end, many of my friends don’t want to know or learn about bitcoin because they assume is a “cryptobro” thing and its about getting rich fast and whatever. Getting free from state money fast and building infrastructure for Bitcoin market adoption is key. I honestly think we’re on an early adoption race.']"

    "1. Stonk\n",
    "Stonk means stock. This term originated with an internment meme of a suited man (presumably a trader) standing in front of some numbers and a big orange arrow, all of it titled “stonks.” The meme was a cheeky reference to making bad financial decisions, sort of like someone who cannot even pronounce stocks correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Diamond Hands\n",
    "The term “diamond hands” refers to holding on to a stock or option despite volatility and losses in the confidence that its price will eventually increase. On memes, the phrase is represented with emojis of a diamond and then hands. The term actually indicates risk taking, and is sometimes the folly of stubbornly holding on to a stock or option until the bitter end, even when the ship should have been abandoned long ago. Whether having diamond hands is good or bad will probably depend on the final outcome of the ticker symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Tendies\n",
    "This one has a bizarre etymology (to say the least). Tendies is short for chicken tenders, and it comes from 4Chan as part of reference to grown men living with their mothers—men who would be rewarded for good behavior and self-sufficiency with GBP (good boy points), which they could then redeem for their favorite food: chicken tenders (we warned you the background was a little strange). The term moved to r/wallstreetbets where members used it self-deprecatingly in reference to their own living arrangements. Eventually, the term came to be associated with money or profit made from stock trading and options trading, which is how it’s most frequently used today.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. YOLO\n",
    "You only live once. This term actually seems to originate from the notion encapsulated in the Latin “carpe diem” (seize the day). It became popularized around 2012, in large part because of its usage in the rap song “The Motto” by Drake and Lil Wayne. In internet parlance, YOLO often humorously refers to an extremely risky choice that seems simultaneously laughable and dangerous. On Wallstreetbets, YOLO could apply to a trade where an investor puts in the majority of their capital—for instance, putting 95 percent of their account into Dogecoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Woman Investing In Stocks Scaled\n",
    "\n",
    "5. HODL\n",
    "HODL might seem to stand for Hold on For Dear Life, the encapsulated notion of which is also popularly expressed in the phrase Hold the Line. But actually, HODL really came about because of a typo for hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "It all started on December 18th in 2013, when user GameKyuubi posted an inebriated, typo-filled, and only partially coherent internet rant about his poor trading skills, and how it would be better for people like himself to avoid day trading and stick to a buy and hold principle. The title of the post was I AM HODLING, and the rest is history. Images from Braveheart, 300, and Game of Thrones have provided the meme substance for promoters of the HODL principle—that is, avoid trading decisions based on short term swings, which can be simply ruinous for stock investors who do not know what they are doing. The HODL principle is particularly discussed in the cryptocurrency venue, where it contrasts against principles such as FOMO (the fear of missing out).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To the Moon\n",
    "As you might guess, this term indicates that a given stock is going to have wild success in terms of its price increase, resulting in a lot of tendies for investors. In emojis, this phrase is indicated by rockets. Gamestock and AMC Theatres are just two examples of stock that members celebrated going to the moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see a sizable number of community members using this phrase to discuss a ticker symbol, it might be something you want to pay attention to. Of course, there are certainly other factors as to whether or not that translates to tangible success beyond the reddit threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take your portfolio to the moon today and join Infinity Investing! As a member, you’ll gain exclusive access to expert stock investing tips and a network of like-minded investors. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Apes Together Strong\n",
    "Often represented with a gorilla emoji, the “apes together strong” phrase comes from Planet of the Apes. Apes are retail investors who feel bullish (optimistic) about a particular stock that is expected by short sellers to drop in price. If enough retail investors band together, they can be strong enough to drive up the price of the stock and defeat the goal of the short sellers, who want the price to fall (short selling involves borrowing a stock, selling it, and then selling it back to the investor after the price has dropped).\n",
    "\n",
    "Apes together strong encapsulates the idea of the proverbial little man uniting with other everyday people to defeat more powerful institutional investors. This was seen recently in 2021 with GameStop and AMC Theaters.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Bears\n",
    "A bear investor is one who feels bearish about a particular stock (or even the stock market in general). They are somewhat of a debbie downer on the r/wallstreetbets forum, and may become the butt end of jokes and insults, since most community members are looking for that next stock or cryptocurrency to go to the moon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tangentially, the phrases bear market and bull market relate to whether the market is going up and down. Since bears strike by coming down on their target, a bear market suggests decreasing stock prices. Because bulls gore their target by moving their horns upward, a bull market suggests increasing prices. Though this imagery is not unique to Wallstreetbets, it’s probably one of the few places where a bearish perspective on a security or the market in general can earn someone the appellation of being a bear themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Buy High Sell Low\n",
    "This is a joke about losses, expressed in a joking reference to the traditional, sensible, and simple advice of buy low and sell high. Someone who bought high and sold low has failed miserably at turning a particular trade into something financially profitable, leaving them at the mercy of jabs from other community members.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Buy the Dip\n",
    "For members who feel overall bullish about a particular stop, slight dips in its generally upward price are a momentary respite to buy the stock at a discount. Buying the dip expresses this timely trade, and is often paired with Diamond Hands and To the Moon for a potent meme trio.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Paper Hands\n",
    "Paper hands are the opposite of diamond hands, referencing traders who unload their shares at the first sign of bad news. As you can imagine, the connotation here is somewhat negative in its indication of a trader who acts too quickly, out of fear.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. We Like the Stock\n",
    "This phrase comes from Jim Cramer, who was the host of Mad Money on CNBC. The simple phrase is used to indicate a favorable attitude toward holding a stock, much in the same way that Cramer would have used the phrase. During the Game Stop Short Squeeze, Cramer actually said “WallStreetBets is too powerful, and trying to bet against them right now is just giving them more ammo,” an accolade that many a community member probably appreciated.\n",

         "I've just found out that this sub is not just a bunch of people who hate Bitcoin Core because they decided to go for segwit instead of XT. I used to follow this sub but stopped following when all I saw was posts about BCH instead of BTC, which is literally in the sub's name, but reading some comments here made me realize that things might be more nuanced that I originally thought here (I mean, I don't see the toxicity of Buttcoin nor the irrationality of reciting the Bitcoin Standard as the bibble).\n\nNow, I've been discussing lately with some BCH supporters, and although I have to recognize that BCH is technically superior to BTC, the thing is that the market decided that BTC was more valuable, even laughable things such as dogecoin and XRP are more valuable to the market right now than BCH, I mean, at the time of writing there are more transactions happening on [BTC's testnet](https://mempool.space/testnet) that there are happening on [BCH's main net.](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash)\n\nI have told many times, to many people, that yes, Digital Gold (or Property if you want to use the word that's gaining traction due to Saylor's narrative) won over Digital Cash, but that doesn't mean that BTC will be hindered forever as a MoE, we've seen that Lightning works great only when fees are low so realistically the solution would be to either scale on-chain or get everyone into the hands of custodians, which I think won't be what the market really wants, and the consensus around BTC is becoming more a more clear every day that we need to scale and the filter/smallblock/ossification cult has to fuck off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my theory is that Bitcoin (BTC) will eventually evolve into what BCH is today, but keeping its history and not BCH's, what would you guys think if this ever comes to be real? Would you feel vindicated even if when you know that you went to \"the wrong chain\"? Would you fight it? Would you simply abide to what the market tells? Would you, in case you're a researcher or developer, help the development of BTC even knowing well how people were treated during the Blocksize war?",

         "This Reddit post is indeed relevant to Bitcoin news. It discusses the potential for Bitcoin (BTC) to evolve into a different form similar to Bitcoin Cash (BCH), despite BCH's initial development from a fork of Bitcoin Core, and how users might react if this were to happen.\n\nThe post touches on several topics related to the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as:\n\n1. Market acceptance: The fact that BTC is more valuable in the market than BCH.\n2. Scalability solutions: The discussion around on-chain scaling or using custodians.\n3. Community dynamics: The filter/smallblock/ossification cult and its impact on the community.\n\nThe post also invites users to share their thoughts on whether they would feel vindicated, fight it, or abide by market demands if BTC were to evolve into a new form similar to BCH. This adds a layer of speculation and exploration to the discussion, making it relevant to Bitcoin news.",

         "['Look at who controls Bitcoin, Blockstream. And what do they offer as p2p electronic cash? A layer 2 called Lightning, riddled with problems, needless complexity and worst of all custodial centralization paths. Why? Just so they can control it and make money off the services they built for it.\\n\\nThat has not and will not work for the rest of the world. It never will. Read the Lightning white paper.\\n\\n\"(K.I.S.S) Keep it simple stupid is a design principle which states that designs and/or systems should be as simple as possible.

It\\'s in a very good technical and utility position, only a maxi would deny that.'\n 'The crippled block/no hardfork cult isnt about scaling. It is about control. It has been cemented in BTCs culture so rigidly, it is impossible to excise. And it is no accident that it makes BTC unusable, that is the purpose. It is also no unfortunate accident that due to BTCs crippled nature, people are herded into centralized/custodial solutions. That is all exactly how the establishment/elites/central banksters want it, something nicely tamed, neutered, controllable, where if need be they can exercise confiscation, censorship, paper-inflation and bail-ins. It is no accident that BTC culture is permeated and soaked in censorship, appeals to authority, begging for tradfi handouts and statism. Scaling BTC, making it usable, would undo all that, and that cant be allowed. BTC has been alotted its reservation to stay in, and it better damn well stay in there or else…\\n\\nAnd even if, by some inconceivable accident, there was to be a hardfork to scale, it would become a minority fork. Except without all the improvements that BCH already made, it would be pointless.'\n 'Imo, BTC is controlled opposition. You might get Dollar rich, but you won\\'t get free or control over your money.\\n\\nIt is likely that BTC stays the collectors token it has become and is used as an SoV, but it could also crumble and collapse.

Samson Mow for example or Saylor and his infamous:\" MoE is a distraction\".\\n\\n\\nBCH might never flip BTC but it doesn\\'t even have tom to succeed. The only win condition is that people use it self custodial and create an alternative economy with it. But if that happens, the value of BCH is likely to go up .'\n '> So my theory is that Bitcoin (BTC) will eventually evolve into what BCH is today, but keeping its history and not BCH\\'s, what would you guys think if this ever comes to be real?\\n\\nI find this event to be extremely unlikely for many reasons. One of the reasons is that it takes a lot to change the BTC culture to be supportive of bigger blocks and optimizing for layer-1 non-custodial UTXO ownership. A much stronger reason though, is that if they tried it\\'s more likely that they would convert people who believe in that vision to users of BCH, as that is the lower cost and faster gratification.\\n\\nWe\\'re actually already seeing that happen, people in BTC are warming up to the idea that bigger blocks might make some sense, or that non-custodial ownership of layer-1 UTXOs are important, but they are being fought back against and ridiculed, and are loosing their social status and support. They are then faced with a choice - keep fighting to change BTC, which lacks a clear path to change (no, getting assigned a BIP number is not enough, and having a usecase is not enough, and writing the code is not enough - in the end you need to do all of it **AND** get ACK from the existing gatekeepers) - or ask others who tried before them where they went and follow them there.\\n\\nYou can revisit the BTC/BCH split for a prime example of how this works - some people were well-served (traders, speculators) while some were poorly served (merchants, layer-1 users) and so over the years prior to the BTC/BCH split people fought to change BTC for what they believed was the better, but their support dwindled over time and more and more other chains offered the solution they were interested in, and so the rebels stopped fighting and moved on to other places instead.\\n\\nNow they\\'re fighting over OP_CAT, CTV and tools that they think will enable the scaling they want, but BTC is still one of the top performer as a speculative asset, and the people who are earning a ton of paper-value (or real, if they realize it) have no motivation to \"improve\" by making risky changes to the underlying protocol.\\n\\nBTC will only learn when it is no longer the speculatively top performer, and by then they will have lost the market and mind share necessary to make the changes in the first place. Or, at least that\\'s how I think it\\'s going to play out.'\n '\"Good luck\" is my position'\n \"BCH is full of old-school Bitcoiners.

That's a threat to the existing systems...\\n\\nIf you were under threat by Bitcoin what would you do to stop it?\\n\\nPreventing its usage (limiting the blocksize) and making it expensive to use (high-fee design) sounds like a good strategy.\\n\\nAnd because Bitcoin has falling block rewards every 4 years you just need to keep delaying its usage, eventually strangling miner revenue, until the mining network shrinks to small enough that it can be easily attacked.\\n\\nEven something like a temporary 1-week long attack, making the entire network unusable, would instantly destroy the entire networks credibility and cause the remainder of the miners revenue (fees from usage+price) to evaporate, further destroying the miners.\\n\\nBTC is on the slow-strangulation path.\\n\\nYou admit that BCH is superior, but the market chose the inferior option ... for now.

It might be too late, but if it isn't, it's the first case scenario.\\n3.

However, like the temporary block size, the scripting was never improved upon over time and it got stuck.\\n\\nVitalik wanted to create smart contracts on Bitcoin in 2013. Unfortunately with Satoshi disappearing, his efforts were rejected by Bitcoin and so he started Ethereum as a proof of concept project. In a way, Ethereum was the first schism from Bitcoin.\\n\\n2013 to 2016 was a dark period, where the conflict of number go up vs disruptive money arose. Established financial interests froze and regressed Bitcoin, while financially paying off the devs and bag holders.\\n\\nIn 2017 Bitcoin finally split into two coins, BTC and BCH. BTC became custodial assets in the legacy system, and BCH became the p2p smart money envisioned by Satoshi and others, with the tech improvements everyone had originally expected to be added to Bitcoin.\\n\\nBTC will remain king as long as its financial backers in the legacy system continue to run things. Essentially this aligns with the overall financial and fiscal stability of the current system, which is on a time clock. In the 2030s, debt obligations will dominate the budget, and the legacy system will begin failing. BTC will lose dominance because the creators of BTC (legacy financial interests) will no longer be able to afford to keep its price dominant.\\n\\nThis is all a very natural, and with hindsight, even expected process.

That, and he had the beliefs and actions of someone I thought was consistent with Satoshi Nakamoto.\\n\\n>My false belief in Craig Wright would go on to damage me financially in truly spectacular fashion. Because Craig told me to use Bitcoin Cash immediately after it launched, believing this was coming from Satoshi Nakamoto, a figure I idolized, I invested my personal savings into Bitcoin Cash and pivoted my business to focus exclusively on Bitcoin Cash. This would turn out to be a disaster in time, as Bitcoin Cash became BSV, and continuously fell in price and adoption.\\n\\n>I used to be a big holder of Bitcoin. I sold all of it to support Craig Wright. Not only did my investments not pan out, but I have missed the giant bull run on Bitcoin as a consequence, even though I am an OG going back to 2011. I am out at least tens of millions of dollars, possibly more. The true scale of the losses will be determined when I account for all of my records.\\n\\n>I realized I had failed in 2020. My business was not profitable, it was not growing, and I realized the technology I had been using exclusively, BSV, had very low prospects of success. I simply had to admit to myself my only option was to exit. I managed to sell the company and then began the long process of unwinding my belief system.\\n\\n>From 2020 until now, I have spent a lot of time ruminating on the trauma I experienced from 2017 - 2020. Now that we know Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto, I understand. I was a cult member and was being manipulated by a psychopath who did not care if he ruined me so long as he had perceived near-term benefit.\\n\\n>One of the reasons why it took me so long to accept that Craig Wright is not Satoshi Nakamoto is that it would have to be a truly huge scam that would ultimately hurt everyone and even himself. Unfortunately, as I have learned, this is a known pattern of behavior for psychopaths. Craig Wright will indeed get his day in court, again, as the number of people he has hurt is enormous, and it is now established in court he has been lying this whole time. Lawsuits are inevitable.\\n\\n>It took four years of meditation and relaxation to grapple with the scope of my error. Even after all that time, I am still in shock with the declarations that came from the judge. The totality of evidence is overwhelming. Craig Wright is simply not Satoshi Nakamoto, and there was never a reason to believe that he was. I was totally wrong in a big way. Evidently, I am not as smart as I thought.\\n\\n>I estimate I am only about 50% of the way detoxed from the cult, even after four years, as I am still learning to accept that there was never any convincing evidence he was Satoshi Nakamoto, and everything I thought I knew was all lies. Fortunately, there is an emerging network of survivors who are in touch and can lend each other support to grapple with the emotions involved in exiting a cult.\\n\\n>Craig Wright was enabled by Calvin Ayre and Stefan Matthews, his co-conspirators going back to 2016 or earlier. While I cannot say for sure what happened from before 2017, I do know that the three of them orchestrated this giant scam. I know this from personal experience, and I am certain evidence exists to link them. Together, they have caused a catastrophe for anyone who got involved with them from the beginning until now.\\n\\n>Please be kind to the remaining cult members.

We had massive overlap in our shared values.  We essentially differed about the dangers of a completely voluntary (not in response to a specific threat) hard fork and the precedent that would set.  We disagreed on the importance of on-chain vs. off-chain scale and the timing of the fork required to address these.  These are very minor disagreements on the backdrop of all that Bitcoin has achieved over the past 15 years.  We have so much more in common than we have differences.\\n\\nWhen I used to post here I tried different techniques, from gentle to harsh, in an attempt to help break through any cognitive barriers.  Nothing worked, or at least I don\\'t think it did.  Now we have Ryan opening people\\'s eyes about BSV and it occurs to me that there is another \"potential\" cult that still apparently fails to acknowledge at least some pretty obvious realities that should now be pretty obvious with the passage of time.

Good for you.\\n\\nBut dont come here and shit on us poors, that you are so rich you piss on money.'\n 'Bullshit BTC propaganda.'\n \"You are low on information.\\n\\nStep outside the BTC bubble and you'll obtain a better picture.\"\n 'You cant compare email to money. Our society is built on money, not on emails. And i defenetly would pay 50.- so i have a decentralized money yes. \\n\\nYou just gonna ignore the lightning argument. I buy my coffee with bitcoin and I have lower transaction fees than you have in BCH... https://www.instagram.com/lepedaleur/ here i buy my coffee with lightning. I order nearly everything online and pay with lightning... Check yourselfe on galaxus.ch (swiss version of amazon wich allready accepts bitcoin payment  + lightning payment). \\n\\nBCH got created by the rich, and the poor chose to stay in BTC. Why are countries like El Salvador, central africa, nigeria, and many more using BTC and not BCH if its \"for the rich\"? \\n\\nThe only reason i am not ultra poor anymore, is bitcoin🤷\\u200d♂️'\n 'Oh i understand BCH. Storage of nodes will be so huge in future, that just huge conpanies and states will be able to run a node. I cant afford a node anymore. So yeah if these big companies want to change Bitcoin, you will just have to accept it. If they want to censor people, other companies or states, they will be able to. The state can just regulate the few companies that are still able to run a node and force them to change bitcoin like they want to. I have my own Bitcoin node. Noone is ever going to be able to take away my voice in this network. \\n\\nCompanies want different things than workers, states want different things than workers. So BCH will change like they want it to be. Real Bitcoin is a compromise of all users. Not just big companies and states. Everyone has the same voting rights. BCH is for the rich. BTC for the poor.'\n '> And i defenetly would pay 50.- so i have a decentralized money yes.\\n\\nCool rich guy. I guess the rest of us will stay poor because we cant afford the insane fees.\\n\\n>You just gonna ignore the lightning argument.\\n\\nCentralized vaporware. We want p2p onchain cash, no third parties, fake lightning that are just using spreadsheets etc. Layer 1 works and BCH is evidence of that.\\n\\n>BCH got created by the rich, and the poor chose to stay in BTC. \\n\\nAbsolute nonsense. Fees are too high for the poor, you\\'ve got your facts backwards.\\n\\n>Why are countries like El Salvador\\n\\nEl Salvador doesnt use BTC, they use offchain centralised fake BTC wallets. Which is not decentralised nor is it crypto, its an excel spreadsheet.\\n\\n>The only reason i am not ultra poor anymore, is bitcoin🤷\\u200d♂️\\n\\nOk rich guy who loves paying $50 for \"decentralized money\", you seem very smart and super cool.'\n '> You are low on information.\\n\\nLike I said. If you\\'re still trotting out the \"storage of nodes will be so huge in future\" argument, then you should read the Bitcoin whitepaper again and catch up things like UTXO commitments, pruning and SPV.\\n\\nBCH isn\\'t for everyone to keep the whole payment history of humanity on their desktop forever and forever, that much is true at least today - but who knows what technology might still surprise us.'\n \"Youve been lied to. \\nYou can mine on a pruned node.\\n\\nAnd your non-mining node does nothing. \\n\\nYou have no 'voice in the network' it you have 0 hash.\\n\\nIts like having the block explorer open in chrome and reading what shows up.

This entity may also kill your pops outright.\\n\\n-Whisperers of The Void: The people become smarter because of \"truths\" alluded to (faster research, more political will, better espionage, better stealth), but also \"go mad from the revelation\" and become unstable individuals, with lower stability and monthly unity (cohesion on a societal level).\\n\\nAll of these are open with how they are however, so this doesn\\'t fit the bill.\\n\\n  \\nThere is a small chance a much more powerful entity called The End of The Cycle will appear.

With gold due to in being a physical thing, you can’t just go an an exchange and dump 1% of its total world supply with just a click of your mouse.\\n\\nBut with bitcoin a company like MS can just load all of their holdings on an exchange and just dump most of them in a matter of minutes if they so chose , or can just gradually keep offloading every day for a few months .\\n\\nWhich is a problem because a major player can dump a lot of coins without a warning and leave and we already see what just a single corporation in Graysacle can do to the price on their own and they haven’t even sold 20% of their holdings. \\n\\nI highly doubt the actual bitcoin liquidity is more than 1% of its MC'\n 'Nah I am not losing anything . I am just more educated than you and not brainwashed into thinking bitcoin is the only crypto that goes up.\\n\\nI am also not into long term investing, once I reach my goal with one coin I move to another and so far it have worked great. I have been trading since a year ago, I lost a bunch in 2023 , made it all back with handful of profits in 2024 and it’s still early on.\\n\\nAnd if I had put all my money back then in bitcoin I would still have made less altogether than what I have now .\\n\\nYou call me an idiot but the only idiot here is the one who judges people without knowing anything about them, you have no idea how I invest and yet you are already an expert about luck/ skill etc .\\n\\nYou judge me without knowing anything about my portfolio, without knowing anything but a couple posts on Reddit .\\n\\nYea you are so smart, you know all there is about crypto .\\n\\nI am sure with all your knowledge you are driving a lambo and don’t have to ever work since you have it all figured out .\\n\\nGood for you']",

LOL.\\n\\n> despite an invitation from Blockstream CEO Adam Back to rejoin the Bitcoin community.'\n 'Headline seems misleading.  Makes it sound like an olive branch, but the reality sounds more like a demand to surrender.  \\n\\nWhat was actually said was \"join the f*cking party @rogerkver\".  \\n> In his message to Ver, Back asks “Bitcoin Jesus” to at last admit defeat and return to his roots. \"You were demonstrably wrong in every way,” he told Ver. “You were also dead wrong in the market to your enormous cost,\" he added.  \\n\\nIn short- \\'hey Roger you should give up on L1 scaling (which you\\'ve been promoting for years) and come join the mess of people working on L2 scaling\\'.  \\n\\n-----\\n\\nMy reaction to this-- \\n\\nFirst they ignore you, then they mock you, then they fight you, then you win.  That\\'s typical logic but it\\'s gotten lopsided here.  \\nIn this incident I think it\\'s first they fight you, then they ignore you, then they mock you, then you win.  We\\'re at Step 3- mocking us.  \\n\\nIDGAF if you can run a full node on a 5 year old Raspberry Pi.  Mining\\'s too centralized anyway so it makes no difference.  I think there\\'s more centralization locking funds up in transaction channels and requiring intermediaries in transactions than there is in making it harder to run a full node.'\n 'Wow a guy rejects floppy disks and prefers modern storage solutions!'\n 'Watching BTC smallblockers trying to win Roger back to their cause is the cringe of 2024'\n 'The article linked Adam Back’s comment but I didn’t see Roger’s reply to it. Did I miss it?'\n '*\"positioning bitcoin cash as a superior alternative*\"\\n\\nAs far as Bitcoin goes, I would describe it the other way around.\\n\\nBitcoin BTC is an inferior alternative to Bitcoin BCH.'\n '\"You can only be part of the BTC community if Adam Back allows it\"\\n\\n\\n- true since at least 2017'\n \"Never felt like I've misplaced any trust in Roger, total stand-up guy. Glad to have someone like him as a public figure in the project\"\n '[deleted]'\n 'Adam Back is a real pos, he goes against everything that Bitcoin was started for.'\n 'very \"cypherpunk\"'\n 'Bitcoin Core devs are bought and paid for by Blockstream. \\n\\nGuy is not just the CEO of Blockstream, but also effectively the CEO of Bitcoin itself.'\n \"Disgraceful they didn't mention whether the invitation was blessed by the bitcoin CEO\"\n \"This feels more like bargaining than mocking - the stages of grief might be more relevant. Like 'please disarm now, you lost' gaslighting just before we win.\"\n 'Started here https://decrypt.co/222206/adam-back-roger-ver-come-home-bitcoin\\n\\nThen with comments from Roger here https://decrypt.co/223349/roger-ver-bitcoin-cash-adam-back-layer-2'\n \"Don't put faith in people. Put faith in ideas.\"\n 'Rule 8. And fake link.\\n\\nMods, how do you prefer to be notified of this? /u/BitcoinXio'\n \"Agreed.  If he could get Ver on the Layer 2 camp that would take a lot of the drive out of L1 scaling.  \\nHe's probably getting desperate that L2 scaling isn't working nearly as well as he'd promised everyone it would (despite tons of dev time and $millions of various investment) and he's worried some of those investors are gonna say 'wait a sec, you mean the only reason we spent all this time and money is so random idiots running nodes don't have to buy a $150 hard drive?'\"\n \"Thanks. Unless I missed it (I only skimmed the text), Ver doesn't seem to have directly replied to Adam. Did I miss it? Where is Ver's specific reply to Adam?\"\n \"That's a suspended account. Can't hear you. Not sure why it's even in the mod list anymore.\\n\\nu/MemoryDealers  (only one short of an admin who can remove it)\"\n \"And that's only an excuse. Non mining nodes don't matter and neither do hashers ('miners' that don't build blocks).\\n\\nMarathon and other big (actual) miners should (will?) go forward with bip 101 unilaterally. Once adults take over.\"\n 'I don’t think he replied to him directly either unless I missed it too.'\n 'Weird that it did not get cleaned up last weekend. ;-)'\n \"> bip 101\\n\\n[been a minute since I heard that one...](https://media1.tenor.com/m/1i5pSb4J2JUAAAAC/starwars-obi-wan.gif)\\n\\nJokes aside- let's say BTC did adopt BIP101 or something similar.  That would create an interesting situation as it would instantly devalue most of the off-chain scaling efforts, and also probably devalue BCH.  \\nIf that happened though I'd like to see BCH make some sort of interesting change to stay relevant- maybe switch the proof of work to some ASIC-resistant hash function...\"\n \"Not even joking. Interesting point about deflating the competition. I'm ok with that if it means BTC can fulfill it's destiny. I bet Ver would be too. \\n\\nMaybe satoshi will rise from the grave and spend his coins on a BCH airdrop amnesty exchange to kill it and fuse the fork. Ok, now I am joking.\\n\\nIf BTC were $1m, I would be ok with BCH at $0. ETH now has the same issue, controlled by its centralized but fast L2s (like BSV or SOL).\"\n \"Personally I think the whole investing aspect and the spot price of this or that coin is literally the least interesting part of crypto.  It's like we built the world's first airplane and a bunch of people said 'hey we can warm up if we stand next to the engine, look at this awesome heater!'.  \\n\\nThe interesting part to me is forcing accessibility into developing or badly regulated markets, free of restrictions and red tape.  Go to a lot of developing countries and getting a bank acct or credit card is stupid expensive so a huge % of the population is just completely shut out of the modern economy.  Crypto fixes that.  With crypto you can send a dollar or a billion dollars to the barista in front of you or a merchant on the other side of the planet, for stupid cheap.  And someone in a poor African village can start to participate in the world economy without anyone's permission or paying fees.  That to me is the interesting part of crypto.  \\nThat all works no matter what the price is.  I just want the price to be stable so that sort of thing can happen without undue risk to such a merchant.  \\n\\nSo I don't care if the answer is BTC or BCH or ETH or some sidechain or L2 or whatever.  I don't care about price.  I care about functionality.  And the functionality I want is what BTC had in the early days- instant dirt cheap transactions for everyone.\"\n 'Yeah, price is a proxy for dominance here.\\n\\nRealistically usdt already solves the problem you describe and it has pretty wide adoption already.'\n \"USDT solves that problem but creates two in its place- 1. you have to trust tether to actually hold USD, and 2. you have to trust USD (when record inflation is devaluing the currency).  \\n\\nFor US residents who live with USD it's no big deal.  For someone in another nation it might be an issue.\"\n \"USD is the gold standard worldwide. They rather have that stability. And people don't really care if it's centralized as long as it's accepted.\\n\\nI'm not that person, but this is what the unbanked need, not a weird libertarian fairy tale.\"]",

It happens to everyone on one issue or another - and BCHers are generally quite principled and stubborn and resilient so they take it hard when they get it wrong sometimes.\\n\\nSo to that end I didn't want to be digging in and alienating them. Particularly for David.  I think in time they'll reflect on the incident and see it from a new light, but my show is not a platform to be making unnecessarily harsh criticism unless it is truly necessary.\"\n \"Will be interesting to see how your tenure goes.  I wish you the best.  As I said in the show, you're starting with relatively little proof of work and recognition but perhaps you earn it over time.\"\n 'I watched a good chunk of the video.  Seems like a pretty reasonable take on what has gone on, at least from what I saw.\\n\\nI\\'d like to address one thing which is the speculation that I could be tempted to sell my account.  I don\\'t have any evidence other than my word so take it for what it is.  So I own [1209k.com](https://1209k.com).  I mostly use it for various side project hosting.  1209k was the address of an apartment I used to live in at college.  Anyways, so I\\'ve run BTC nodes and electrum nodes for a very long time and one of my nodes ([b.1209k.com](https://b.1209k.com)) was in an old version of electrum as one of the default seed nodes.  Some of those old versions of electrum have a kinda vulnerability.  Namely, if a server sends a message the message will be displayed as a pop-up to the user with URLs clickable.  This of course is a big problem and leads people to downloading malware.  Basically, the user connects to a bad server, the server sends a pop-up that says \"update now - you are out of date\" and gives a link.  People understandably click on the link.  So any hostname in those old versions is a hot commodity for some people to own.\\n\\nAnyways, due to this I\\'ve gotten some big offers on the [1209k.com](https://1209k.com).  They never say it is to scam people out of their money.  There is a good chance the brokers reaching out don\\'t even know, but I\\'ve always said no.  I think I was offered $50k once.  I turned that down.  I mean, I can probably be bought but it would have to be a lot of digits.  I have been in Bitcoin long enough that I am pretty set moneywise.  Since the sundering I have turned most of my BTC into real estate and kept most of my BCH.\\n\\nSo I might made dumb or wrong decisions but selling my account will not something that will happen.

That was when Bitcoin went from $10 to $1100 (and back down to $250).\\n\\nThere was a large effort even then to onboard shop owners but here is my conclusion... it is very unfruitful for the shop owners. They go through all the effort to accept crypto, engage in a bunch of promotion and then ... nothing! The reason is that there are still so few owners of it (and, too, those that do are \"hodlers\" and not very good customers).\\n\\nSo I\\'ve been working on a solution by enabling website operators to earn it. It is a crypto-only, cooperative ad network but I think the business model would work in other business sectors. In ours, in order for the advertisers to get the best ad positions, they have to bid and pay with crypto. Their payments then generate commissions to the website that landed the advertiser (and continuously for as long as the advertiser pays). Since there are 2.1 billion websites, this business model will turn many of them into potential crypto-paying customers.\\n\\nWe circle back around to point out that the advertisers will need crypto AND those advertisers are nearly always businesses. This, too, will incentivize them to accept crypto (i.e. since they can use their crypto income to buy better ad position).\\n\\nBasically I believe (and am building the platform) that will be the next phase of crypto when it will be enabling workers to choose to get paid with it (instead of fiat). When crypto achieves that it \"has arrived\" and will finally be a bona-fide currency.']",

But all those miners have to run a mempool to connect tx, and since all mempools connect to all mempools. When a new block is found and filled up with tx, all the other miners already have those tx in their mempool anyways. Well maybe not all of them, but in practise they have about 99%.\\n\\nGraphene and xthinner are two protocols active on BCH where when a miner needs to send a new block to the other miners, there is some communication between the two where they figure out what tx they already have and what are missing. Then only the difference is send. \\n\\nBut that does allow a 1 GB block to spread much faster then if the entire block needed to be send from mempool to mempool to mempool. And that's important because if blocks don't spread fast enough miners start losing their rewards and grouping together, leading to centralisation.\"\n 'The term is *domain compression*. 7zip doesn\\'t use domain compression because it is a general compressor that will work on any sort of file. Whereas a purpose built domain compression uses knowledge of the working \"domain\" to improve compression.\\n\\nFor example JPEG compresses pictures better than 7zip because it leverages aspects of images (the image domain) to reduce file sizes. JPEG uses math to approximate the color gradient found in photos because colors naturally blend from one color to another. That\\'s why JPEG does a poor job of encoding line art; it\\'s not natural. JPEG is also *lossy* which means it can throw out some of the more subtle differences that really can\\'t be detected by the human eye.\\n\\nLikewise, MPEG video compression encodes each subsequent video frame using the prior frame, because most video doesn\\'t change much from one frame to the next. That\\'s why a compressor built specifically for their targeted domain (discipline) can compress much better than a generic Zip. 7zip would simply attempt to compress each and every frame in whole, whereas MPEG only compresses the *entropy* (differences) from one frame to the next.\\n\\nFor the reconciliation of blocks, or the blockchain domain, since the miners already receive all (or most) of the blocks as they go, they only need to reconcile the differences with the winning Miner. Only the *entropy* needs to be encoded and transmitted, which makes it much more efficient than generically compressing the whole thing with 7zip. And as it so happens, once the entropy has been extracted, it is likely the resulting bits are transmitted to the other host using gzip.'\n \"I've not seen this good compression level. 99.6% for xthinner is using 4MB on 1GB block, which is still fantastic.

As of August 2017, ZHONG thus possessed 50,000 BCH in addition to the 50,000 Bitcoin that ZHONG unlawfully obtained from Silk Road.  ZHONG thereafter exchanged through an overseas cryptocurrency exchange all of the BCH Crime Proceeds for additional Bitcoin, amounting to approximately 3,500 Bitcoin of additional crime proceeds.

         " I've noticed a trend lately where many of us are getting caught up in the excitement of price pumps and market speculation. While it's natural to feel exhilarated when the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) surges, I believe it's essential for us to maintain perspective and focus on what truly matters: BCH adoption.\n\nAs passionate supporters of Bitcoin Cash, our ultimate goal should be to see widespread adoption of this revolutionary cryptocurrency. We envision a future where BCH is used for everyday transactions, providing people with a fast, reliable, and low-cost means of transferring value across the globe.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile, and price pumps can be short-lived. Moreover, the recent developments surrounding Tether serve as a stark reminder of the risks associated with centralized stablecoins. **If the US government decides to crack down on Tether or other stablecoins, it could have significant implications for the entire crypto market, including BCH.**\n\nInstead of fixating solely on short-term price movements, let's channel our energy into promoting BCH adoption and building the infrastructure necessary for its mainstream use. Here are a few ways we can contribute to the growth of BCH:\n\n1. **Educate Others:** Spread awareness about the benefits of BCH compared to traditional payment systems and other cryptocurrencies. Share informative articles, videos, and resources to help newcomers understand why BCH is worth considering.\n2. **Merchant Adoption:** Encourage businesses to accept BCH as a form of payment. Reach out to local merchants and online retailers, highlighting the advantages of BCH transactions, such as low fees and fast confirmation times.\n3. **Community Outreach:** Organize meetups, workshops, and conferences to connect with fellow BCH enthusiasts and onboard new users. Collaboration and grassroots efforts play a vital role in fostering adoption and building a strong community around BCH.\n4. **Developing Applications:** Support developers working on projects that enhance the BCH ecosystem, such as wallets, decentralized exchanges, and decentralized applications. By contributing to the development of BCH infrastructure, we can make it more accessible and user-friendly for everyone.\n5. **Lead by Example:** Use BCH for your own transactions whenever possible, whether it's buying goods and services or tipping content creators online. Demonstrating the practical utility of BCH helps showcase its real-world value and encourages others to follow suit.\n\nBy prioritizing BCH adoption over price speculation, we can lay the foundation for a more resilient and sustainable future for Bitcoin Cash. Let's stay focused on our long-term vision and work together to make BCH the go-to cryptocurrency for people around the world.\n\nTogether, we can make a difference.\n\nSpend and replace :)",
